With a spider between me and the bureau, I decided against taking a look.

---------------------------------------------

There was no sign of Lobineau when I got to the caf�.
I decided to order a coffee and wait for him.
I was sure I'd asked for cream in my coffee, but he'd brought me black.
The coffee was very bitter and only lukewarm.
There was also an unpleasant, coagulated lump at the bottom of the cup.
The coffee had developed an oily film on the surface.
The cup was empty apart from an unpleasant brown stain and a thick lump.
It was black, even though I was sure I'd asked for cream.
That was undoubtedly the most disgusting cup of coffee I'd ever tasted in my life!

It was a small, silver flask from which the man was topping up his glass.
I couldn't snatch the man's flask while he was looking.
The man was still looking...
The man at the next table looked somehow familiar.
I snuck another look at the guy at the other table, but I still couldn't place his face.
The ex-gendarme showed no effects from the wine he was pouring down his throat.
The old guy was lost in self pity and alcoholic melancholy.
It was too hot to sit inside the caf�.
Besides, I might miss Lobineau.
The waiter's stained and crumpled clothes looked as if they'd been slept in.
I decided not to bother with a meal...
That waiter didn't seem to care much about his appearance or his customers.
I had no place to go, except back to Oubier's house.
Besides, I didn't want to miss Lobineau, so I decided to sit tight and wait.
Now I had another lead.
I could either go back to Oubier's house, or visit the Glease Gallery.
The street led back to the center of Paris.
I had no desire to go down into the sewers.
I grabbed the flask and was struck by a powerful smell of absinthe...
...a highly potent and illegal alcoholic drink.

Pardon me... but don't I know you?
Huh?
You were here, the day I found the catacombs...
I was? Ah, yes. I remember you.
Yeah. Are you still in the police force?
No. Not any more. I am a man of leisure.
And what brings you back to Paris?
But she wanted to rush off to see some professor.
My girl friend.
Ah! What it is to be young and in love!
Do you miss being a gendarme?
Ah! Yes, of course I do!
Not any more!
I'm waiting for... an acquaintance.
Bon. And you have found another.
Will you share a bottle of wine with me?
Hey, listen - I'd love to, but I need to keep a clear head.
So my company isn't good enough for you!
Why did you leave the police?
Leave me alone.
I was forced to retire.
The golden handshake, only in my case it was more copper than gold...
How come?
I was made a scapegoat to cover up the department's inefficiencies.

You need anything else?
Hey - you!
Quoi?
I'd like a cup of coffee, if you don't mind.
When I finish serving this gentleman!
She died. In suspicious circumstances.
The waiter wouldn't have been interested...
Oh, Gar�on!
He ignored me! I'm sure it was deliberate...
There was nothing I wanted to say to him.
Un caf�.
Thanks.
That's all.
Thank you.
You want another caf�?
I'd rather die of thirst.
I ordered cream.
You got cream.
Yeah? How come I don't see it?
It's probably sunk to the bottom of the cup...
Do you expect me to pay for this crap?
You won't get far if you don't.
What's this worm doing in my coffee?-You're a real joker, pal.
Laugh a minute.
Do me a favor and find somewhere else to annoy people...
There's something incubating in the bottom of my cup, gar�on.
You asked for it.
That's the cream.
But... it's all in one lump!
No problem. I'll bring you a fork.
Forget it!
What does that guy keep pouring out of his flask?
Absinthe.Absinthe? I thought that was highly dangerous and outlawed in France?
It is. Don't look at me - I didn't sell it to him.
Do you know a guy called Andr� Lobineau?
Oui. I know him. What of it?
I'm supposed to meet him here. Did I miss him?
Non. I have not seen him today.
Have you heard of Professor Oubier?
Oui. He married that actress, the Little Dachshund.
They used to come here - the nutty professor and the movie star.
Why would an eminent public figure like Oubier risk everything for murder?
He wouldn't be the first, would he? Besides, people like him always get off.
He was kicked out of the force a few months ago.If Oubier's wife was a movie star, how come I never heard of her?
---She was big in France. The world doesn't stop at Hollywood!
-Her stage name was Carol Kleimachs.
How did Oubier's wife die?
I heard he shot her.
And got away with it?
He had a good lawyer and a watertight alibi.
Do you know that man over there?
I should think so! He's a regular customer.
Who is he?
A man with a secret. He used to be a cop.
-Of course! I'd met the gendarme in this very caf�.-
Look at this - a poisoned dart.Ah, oui - sure.
It's the real thing. Knocked my girlfriend out cold in a matter of seconds!
Romantic. Sounds like a real close relationship you have going...
Care for a shot of absinthe?
Ah, non. I've seen what it can do to a man...
Look at him! Just six months ago he was a gendarme...
Now he's a barely coherent, bombastic fool!
He was like that last time I met him.
Since then he's been drinking himself stupid.
His liver must look like the last pickle in the jar!

--Walking out on her was the best thing you could do...
My father was dying dammit! I had no choice.Well, she soon recovered once she went back to her old friends.
--Drop it, Andr�. Right now, Nico's in danger, and we have to work together.
-So how can I help?See you later.Goodbye, Georgie.
Nico needed to speak to Oubier about a stone...
Oh. You mean this stone...
So that's what all the trouble is about!
--Precisely. Nicole told me to guard it with my life.
It's worth more than that, surely...?
Oh, very funny.
What's funny is that your life really is on the line.
What are you talking about?The stone is a Mayan artifact, dummy.
And the guy who kidnapped Nico was from Central America.
Oh, my god! You mean I could be in danger too?
What do you suppose the carving on the stone means?
I don't know. I haven't shown it to anyone.
Why don't you just give it to me?
I don't want your death on my conscience, George.
-Where did Nico get the stone?
It was sent to her.From where? Who?
I'm not sure I should tell you.
Oh, you should...
-It was something to do with smuggling.
----Why didn't Nico take the stone to Oubier?
I don't know. Perhaps she suspected something like this would happen...
If she's been hurt, Andr�, I'll break every bone in your body!
Oh, that's typical of you. Do you think I don't care what happens to Nicole?
---Tell me about your friend Oubier...
He's more of a professional acquaintance than a friend.
I see. So you don't really know him at all.
No, I don't.
Does Oubier employ a guy from Central America?
Maybe, I don't know.
You've never been to his house? I thought you guys were pals?
Fellow academics, Georgie. It's not quite the same thing.-------------------------------
What do you think this is, Andr�?
I don't know.
I'll give you a clue - it's got more backbone than you...
You think you're amusing, don't you? What can you tell me about this pot?
Hmm. South or Central American, I'd say. I have a friend who'd be able to tell you more.
Where can I find this guy?
He owns a gallery on the Left Bank: the Glease gallery.
Take a look at this, Andr�...It's a bank statement.
Yeah. Professor Oubier's account.
-Five large cash withdrawals in the space of three days.
All from an automatic teller in Marseilles. Suspicious, isn't it?
You're even more crazy than you were before....

And now his butler has kidnapped her.
And he tried to kill me.

Well, well. This is a surprise, Georgie...It was the stone they were after.Okay...

I wouldn't normally call you. I felt an irrational urge to wipe my ear... But Nico's in trouble, Andr�, deep trouble.
You have to help me find her.
What? What have you dragged her into this time?
It was YOU that recommended Professor Oubier as an expert on Mayan Art!
I really needed to know more from Lobineau before I let him go.

It occurred to me that slugs don't have bones to break, but I kept that thought to myself.
I didn't think he'd be interested.
{Lobineau hangs up}
I had nothing left to ask him just then.
Every time she gets involved with you, there is trouble.
