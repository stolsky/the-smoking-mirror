There was no sign of Lobineau when I got to the caf�.
I decided to order a coffee and wait for him.
I was sure I'd asked for cream in my coffee, but he'd brought me black.
The coffee was very bitter and only lukewarm.
There was also an unpleasant, coagulated lump at the bottom of the cup.
The coffee had developed an oily film on the surface.
The cup was empty apart from an unpleasant brown stain and a thick lump.
It was black, even though I was sure I'd asked for cream.
That was undoubtedly the most disgusting cup of coffee I'd ever tasted in my life!
It was a small, silver flask from which the man was topping up his glass.
I couldn't snatch the man's flask while he was looking.
The man was still looking...
The man at the next table looked somehow familiar.
I snuck another look at the guy at the other table, but I still couldn't place his face.
The ex-gendarme showed no effects from the wine he was pouring down his throat.
The old guy was lost in self pity and alcoholic melancholy.
It was too hot to sit inside the caf�.Besides, I might miss Lobineau.
The waiter's stained and crumpled clothes looked as if they'd been slept in.
I decided not to bother with a meal...
That waiter didn't seem to care much about his appearance or his customers.
I had no place to go, except back to Oubier's house.
Besides, I didn't want to miss Lobineau, so I decided to sit tight and wait.
Now I had another lead.
I could either go back to Oubier's house, or visit the Glease Gallery.
The street led back to the centre of Paris.
I had no desire to go down into the sewers.
I grabbed the flask and was struck by a powerful smell of absinthe...
...a highly potent and illegal alcoholic drink.

You need anything else?
Hey - you!
Quoi?
I'd like a cup of coffee, if you don't mind.
When I finish serving this gentleman!
She died. In suspicious circumstances.
The waiter wouldn't have been interested...
Oh, Gar�on!
He ignored me! I'm sure it was deliberate...
There was nothing I wanted to say to him.
Un caf�.
Thanks.
That's all.
Thank you.
You want another caf�?
I'd rather die of thirst.
I ordered cream.
You got cream.
Yeah? How come I don't see it?
It's probably sunk to the bottom of the cup...
Do you expect me to pay for this crap?
You won't get far if you don't.
What's this worm doing in my coffee?
You're a real joker, pal. Laugh a minute.
Do me a favour and find somewhere else to annoy people...
There's something incubating in the bottom of my cup, gar�on.
You asked for it. That's the cream.
But... it's all in one lump!
No problem. I'll bring you a fork.
Forget it!
What does that guy keep pouring out of his flask?
Absinthe.
Absinthe? I thought that was highly dangerous and outlawed in France?
It is. Don't look at me - I didn't sell it to him.
Do you know a guy called Andr� Lobineau?
Oui. I know him. What of it?
I'm supposed to meet him here. Did I miss him?
Non. I have not seen him today.
Have you heard of Professor Oubier?
Oui. He married that actress, the Little Dachshund.
They used to come here - the nutty professor and the movie star.
Why would an eminent public figure like Oubier risk everything for murder?
He wouldn't be the first, would he? Besides, people like him always get off.
He was kicked out of the force a few months ago.
If Oubier's wife was a movie star, how come I never heard of her?
She was big in France. The world doesn't stop at Hollywood!
Her stage name was Carol Kleimachs.
How did Oubier's wife die?
I heard he shot her.
And got away with it?
He had a good lawyer and a watertight alibi.
Do you know that man over there?
I should think so! He's a regular customer.
Who is he?
A man with a secret. He used to be a cop.
Of course! I'd met the gendarme in this very caf�.
Look at this - a poisoned dart.
Ah, oui - sure.
It's the real thing. Knocked my girlfriend out cold in a matter of seconds!
Romantic. Sounds like a real close relationship you have going...
Care for a shot of absinthe?
Ah, non. I've seen what it can do to a man...
Look at him! Just six months ago he was a gendarme...
Now he's a barely coherent, bombastic fool!
He was like that last time I met him.
Since then he's been drinking himself stupid.
His liver must look like the last pickle in the jar!


Pardon me... but don't I know you?
Huh?
You were here, the day I found the catacombs...
I was? Ah, yes. I remember you.
Yeah. Are you still in the police force?
No. Not any more. I am a man of leisure.
And what brings you back to Paris?
But she wanted to rush off to see some professor.
My girl friend.
Ah! What it is to be young and in love!
Do you miss being a gendarme?
Ah! Yes, of course I do!
Not any more!
I'm waiting for... an acquaintance.
Bon. And you have found another.
Will you share a bottle of wine with me?
Hey, listen - I'd love to, but I need to keep a clear head.
So my company isn't good enough for you!
Why did you leave the police?
Leave me alone.
I was forced to retire. The golden handshake, only in my case it was more copper than gold...
How come?
I was made a scapegoat to cover up the department's inefficiencies.
Ever heard of Carol Kleimachs, the movie star?...and he was a close friend of the director of the museum I was supposed to be patrolling!
Just a rusty old tripod!
The tripod I'd returned a few weeks later...
Yes, but I don't care for the kind of movies she's made.
It's smut like that which has caused the moral decline of the Western World!
Is it true that Carol Kleimachs was murdered by her husband?
First I heard of it. I thought she'd just retired.
I'm trying to find my girlfriend. She's been kidnapped.
He wouldn't have wanted that.
I had nothing else I wanted to ask the gendarme.
Kidnapped?
Yeah. It was our first day back together after many months.
That's too bad. My god, that's depressing!
I'd been looking forward to seeing my girl...
I see. And you think she's having an affair with this professor...?
Have you ever heard of a Professor Oubier?
Non, m'sieur. I don't recall the name.
Apparently, he's an expert on Mayan art and history.
A little out of my field of experience, m'sieur.
If he'd been a serial killer or a sodomite, I might have been able to help...
What's that you're drinking?
It's wine.
The waiter says it's absinthe...
That fool wouldn't know Pernod from cat's piss.
Tell me what you make of this note.
From my years of experience I gained a pretty good insight into handwriting...
I'd say that note was written by a compulsive-obsessive type with an Oedipus complex.
Hey! You got just about everything apart from the pony-tail!
What do you make of this dart?
Ah! I remember a case where the victim was killed with just such a device!
The poison acted in seconds, causing his body to swell up like an inflatable life raft.
What do you make of this newscutting?
'Orphanage supplied fast food chain...?!
'No - it's the article above that.
Oh - 'Total eclipse of the sun...' Well, that's very dull in comparison.
I don't know anything about eclipses.
Look - forget it. It doesn't matter.
Didn't you try to appeal against your dismissal?
Which museum was it you were supposed to be patrolling?
Excuse me...
What?
Get off!
When I wore that uniform, I commanded respect...
There was no point. It was my word against that of the chief inspector...
The Crune. It wasn't as if anything important was stolen...




But Nico's in trouble, Andr�, deep trouble.
You have to help me find her.
What? What have you dragged her into this time?
It was YOU that recommended Professor Oubier as an expert on Mayan Art!
I really needed to know more from Lobineau before I let him go.
The best lead that we have is Quaramonte City
...Quaramonte? It's in Central America. That's where Oubier gets his artefacts.
It occurred to me that slugs don't have bones to break, but I kept that thought to myself.
I didn't think he'd be interested.

{Lobineau hangs up}
I had nothing left to ask him just then.
Every time she gets involved with you, there is trouble.
The little guy kept saying Quaramonte...
Perhaps the name is significant.
Walking out on her was the best thing you could do
...My father was dying dammit! I had no choice.
Well, she soon recovered once she went back to her old friends.
Drop it, Andr�. Right now, Nico's in danger, and we have to work together.
So how can I help?
See you later.
Goodbye, Georgie.
Nico needed to speak to Oubier about a stone...
Oh. You mean this stone...
So that's what all the trouble is about!
Precisely. Nicole told me to guard it with my life.
It's worth more than that, surely...?
Oh, very funny.
What's funny is that your life really is on the line.
What are you talking about?
The stone is a Mayan artefact, dummy.
And the guy who kidnapped Nico was from Central America.
Oh, my god! You mean I could be in danger too?
What do you suppose the carving on the stone means?
I don't know. I haven't shown it to anyone.
Why don't you just give it to me?
I don't want your death on my conscience, George.
Where did Nico get the stone?
It was sent to her.
From where? Who?
I'm not sure I should tell you.
Oh, you should...
It was something to do with smuggling.
Why didn't Nico take the stone to Oubier?
I don't know. Perhaps she suspected something like this would happen...
If she's been hurt, Andr�, I'll break every bone in your body!
Oh, that's typical of you. Do you think I don't care what happens to Nicole?
Tell me about your friend Oubier...
He's more of a professional acquaintance than a friend.
I see. So you don't really know him at all.
No, I don't.
Does Oubier employ a guy from Central America?
Maybe, I don't know.
You've never been to his house?
I thought you guys were pals?
Fellow academics, Georgie.
It's not quite the same thing.

What do you think this is, Andr�?
I don't know.
I'll give you a clue - it's got more backbone than you...
You think you're amusing, don't you? What can you tell me about this pot?
Hmm. South or Central American, I'd say. I have a friend who'd be able to tell you more.
Where can I find this guy?
He owns a gallery on the Left Bank: the Glease gallery.
Take a look at this, Andr�...
It's a bank statement.Yeah. Professor Oubier's account.
Five large cash withdrawals in the space of three days.
All from an automatic teller in Marseilles.
Suspicious, isn't it?
You're even more crazy than you were before....
George! Where have you been?
Never mind that. Do you have the Mayan stone?
Maybe I have, but...
Don't argue, Andr�. Give the stone to George.
Well, of course. If you say so, Nicole.
Thank you so much, Andr�.
Georgie told me you'd been kidnapped, my dear!
I'm glad to see he was mistaken.
Oh, but it was true! If it hadn't have been for George I wouldn't be here now...
It's not finished yet. Karzac's thugs will be back for that stone, you can bet.

Much as I hated to admit it, Lobineau was the only lead I had left.
In that dusty archive he called a mind he had to know something to help find Nico.
It was just a question of pumping it out of him.
That's all we needed to know. Come on, George!

_____________________________________________________________
GLEASE GALLERY:

The Glease gallery had style and class...
...but very few customers.
It was a machine for reading credit cards.
I had no possible use for a credit card reader.
The glass was half full of wine.
The glass now held a potent mixture of wine and absinthe.
The way that guy was gripping the glass I'd need a wrench to get it away from him.
I splashed a little absinthe into the glass and hoped he wouldn't notice the change of colour...
Allow me...
I thought about dipping the poisoned dart into his drink, but thought better of it.
The girls were in a world of their own.
He looked like an older version of Lobineau.
The same supercilious expression, the same disdain in his eyes...
...and the same damned pony tail.
The guy was watching me like a hawk.
It was Glease, the owner of the gallery.
Glease wasn't happy, I could tell.
It was a label bearing a company name and logo.
Underneath a logo of a flying bird were the words 'Kondor Transglobal, Mars...'.
The rest of the label was missing.
He was a pear-shaped guy with a fine display of multiple chins...
It was Laine, the art critic.
He was out for the count.
I couldn't believe it! The pots were marked at five thousand francs - each!
As far as I could tell, the pots were almost identical to the one I'd found in Oubier's house!
At that price, I wasn't going anywhere near those pots!
The pots were protected by a glass case.
There was nothing in the case but styrofoam packing...
...but pasted on the side was the remains of a label.
The packing case contained nothing but styrofoam chips.
The door led out to the street.
I wasn't going to waste my breath on that drunkard.
A valuable relic of an ancient civilisation lay smashed on the floor.
The pot had smashed into too many pieces to retrieve.
Lots of hugely expensive pots.
The cabinet contained a fine array of pots.
All marked at five thousand francs!
So the pot from Oubier's house must be worth a fortune!
Pots, pots and more pots.
All hugely expensive.
There was nothing worth retrieving from the mess.
Fragments of priceless pots lay shattered on the floor.
The glass stopped me from picking up the exhibits.
I didn't think much of any of these artefacts.
Looked like a witch and a headless bust.
I had seen better.
"Spheres in a barren waste".
Very profound.
I could see a pattern emerging in this artist's work.
"Rectangles in a desolate landscape".
Highly cubist.
"The wasteland".
Too minimalistic for too much money.
It was a sturdy packing case.


Did you put something in my drink?
Uh - yeah. I did. What d'you think?
Well, it's certainly an improvement on Glease's wine...
In fact, I could grow to like it!
Are you Mr Glease, the owner?
Good god, no!
Then I guess that must be him over there, right?
What's the difference between my pot and all those other pots?
Yours is broken.
What's that you're drinking?
I'm not sure, but I have a suspicion it might be urine.
Glease can't expect a favourable criticism of his gallery when he serves this muck!
I wasn't going to waste any more breath talking to that pompous blimp.
I'd had enough of talking to that slob...
I wasn't going to get any sense out of that fool...
Would you give me your opinion on this pot, sir?
Hmm...Yes... Very rapouche.
Rapouche?
Hideous.
You smashed my pot!
Certainly. It was not only worthless, it was ugly and offensive!
To you, maybe...
Believe me, I was doing you a favour.
Have you heard of Professor Oubier?
Correct. Can't you see I'm busy?
Busy? Doing what?
Appreciating the art.
I could tell this guy was going to be hard work...
Maybe I could turn the situation to my advantage, and at the same time get my revenge!
Why, you smug, pompous sloth!
Sticks and stones, dear boy, sticks and stones!
Yes, of course.
I was at his house earlier...
If you're going to drop names, you could at least name one worth dropping!
That pot you smashed belonged to Professor Oubier.
Did it really? I thought the man had more taste.
Why, his last book was nothing but pseudo-intellectual clap-trap...
Your powers of deductive reasoning astound me...
You're Laine, the critic, aren't you?
I thought Oubier was a well-respected man?
...the demented ramblings of a drug-dependant has-been.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Or depreciating it. I have a reputation to uphold. Do you know much about Central American art?
Of course I do, dear boy. I am a critic. And I am busy.


Look at this mess! Smashed beyond repair!
Were those pots very valuable?
It was beginning to make sense.
I suppose you have an import license for these relics?
Of course. But that's not my problem, sir.
Oh no you don't!
Excuse me! There really is nothing to see back there...
One has to so patient with these critics...
Lure them in with the correct bait, watch for a bite, then play them like a fish!
It's rather a mess, sir.
Excuse me, sir!
Uh huh?
That area is private.
Oh. So I'm not allowed back here?
No, sir.
I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.
Certainly, sir. I'd be most happy to oblige.
You're English?
These days, one prefers to think of oneself as European.
Sure. Whatever you say.
And how, precisely, may one assist you, sir?
The Professor arranges all the shipping. We simply collect the items from the docks.
Could you tell me which docks Professor Oubier uses to import the artefacts?
Good god, no! I can't possibly reveal my commercial secrets.
Have you ever heard of the Kondor Transglobal shipping company?
No, sir.
So how do your goods get sent from overseas?
My buyers take care of the shipping arrangements.
I found this news story referring to a total eclipse of the sun...
Really, sir? Well, well. Fascinating.
Well, he's certainly drinking like one.
So did I - until that slob smashed it!
What I really wanted to ask you about was a black stone...
A... black stone?
Yeah. It's a Mayan artefact, 'bout as big as my hand.
No, sir. One doesn't get much call for 'black stones'.
If it's Mayan artefacts you're interested in, I have some rather exquisite pots...
Yeah. I noticed. I've already got one of those.
Go away!
Who is that slob, sprawled out on the floor?
How come that Laine guy is so rude?
Do you believe the story that Oubier murdered his wife?
If it was true, who can blame him?
She was an opportunist tramp. Well, that's what I heard.
Have you seen any of Oubier's wife's films?
Only one. Believe me - I was appalled, shocked, disgusted and repulsed!
Well, you sure got your money's worth.
Last time I went to the movies I wasn't even titillated.
Who's that guy over there?
That's Mr Laine, sir - the critic. I'm hoping he'll give the gallery a favourable write-up...
That slob Laine just smashed my Mayan pot!
Ye-es. He can be rather... impulsive.
He's drunk. If I were you I'd throw him out before he breaks something.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Impulsive? The man's a hooligan!
I bet if it was one of yours you'd be more concerned.
It seems to be a standard requirement for critics.
That's Mr Laine - the critic. And he is going to pay for this damage.
There is a gentleman over there who seems to be enjoying your wine...
I can't think why. It was very cheap.
Well, he doesn't want to talk to me.
If I was you I'd give him a wide berth, sir.
That suits me. I wouldn't want to get too close to him anyhow...
I hope to god Oubier has plenty more of these pots at the docks...
If not - I'm ruined!
Okay - I get the message. Oubier had organized Nico's abduction. Oubier withdrew money from Marseilles...
Have you heard of Professor Oubier?
Of course. His name is synonymous with Mayan art.
Yes Sir. May I help you?
A number of these artefacts were supplied by Oubier himself.
Do you get many Central American Indians in here?
No, sir. This is Paris.
Central America is several thousand kilometres south west of here.
Straight across the Atlantic Ocean and turn left - you can't miss it.
Well, as it happens I saw some Central American Indians this very morning...
Tourists, sir. Paris is full of them at this time of year...
I have some questions I'd like to ask about those pots...
The Mexican collection? Certainly, sir.
Where did you get them from?
Mexico, of course. I think sir will find the price extremely reasonable.
Hey, I'm not interested in buying them!
Oh, I see. In that case, you'll excuse me.
Laine doesn't think much of your choice of wine...
Blasted nerve! The priest who sold it to me said it was a good year!
Oubier was connected with Transglobal, who shipped their goods from a warehouse in Marseilles!
That's how the torn Transglobal label had once read - Marseilles, not Mars!
It wasn't much of a lead but it was all I had.
I didn't think he'd be interested in that.
I set off immediately to catch the evening train.
There was nothing else I wanted to ask the man.
I'd like your opinion on this pot.
Interesting. Would sir be interested in selling the article?
That depends. How much would you give me for it?
Three hundred, possible three twenty five...What?! Those other pots are priced at five thousand francs each!
Yes, but this is clearly the work of an inferior, degenerated culture.
You mean it's English?
Look - why don't you get a second opinion?
From who?
Mr Laine. The world renowned art critic and collector.
He's an art critic? I thought there was a carnival in town...
I'll think about it.
How come there's such a price difference between my pot and the others on display?
Those are much older, sir - and of far superior quality.
They look the same to me...
To an untrained eye, they would.
The pots are insured - but not the shelving!
You've no idea how much that cost me!



_____________________________________________________________



It was the box of biscuits I'd taken from the watchman's hut.
'Gourmet Dog - the snack your dog would bake himself.
'Right! As if I'd let a stupid dog loose in my kitchen!
There was a cute picture of a boxer dog wearing oven mittens...
'This product has not been tested on animals.'
It was a short wooden handled boat hook.
It was the empty beer bottle which that slob of a watchman had dumped in the sea.
It was the metal cone I'd taken from the chimney of the watchman's hut.


It was a plain pancake.
It was my lucky piece of coal.
It was a small, screw-fit cylindrical housing.
The label read 'Surge - the beer that clears your head.'
It was a flint carving of a grotesque figure with large, evil eyes
It was the flint statue I'd found in the warehouse at Marseilles.
It was the flint statue of Tezcatlipoca I'd found in Marseilles,
It was the flask of absinthe I'd borrowed from the gendarme.
It was a label bearing the name 'Kondor Transglobal'.
It was the label I'd found in the Glease Gallery.

It wasn't Nico's lipstick, and it wasn't mine. So whose was it?



It was the Coyote Stone.There was nothing useful in the bag.
The reed was a lot shorter since that creature had savaged it.


The dart fitted snugly into the reed. Great! I was tooled-up and dangerous!
The marker clipped firmly onto the net.



It was the black obsidian stone which had been sent to Nico.
One side bore a grotesque image of a dog's head.
The other was blank.
It was a small brass key.
The cone contained the extract of the shaman's root which I hoped would cure Nico...
It was the strip of masking tape which the big Indian had used to gag Nico.
It was the rope the Indian had used to tie Nico to a chair.Boy, what a souvenir.
It was the detonator I'd taken from the mining company's office.
It was the Eagle stone.
It was a stale bun which could easily have passed for a rock.
It was a pair of binoculars.
Ketch's crucifix was encrusted with precious gems.
It was an Obsidian dagger -  thin, and razor sharp.
It was the Obsidian dagger I'd borrowed from the British Museum.
I guess when all this was over I'd have to return it...
The fish was wet and slimy and decidedly dead.
It was a hairclip.
There was nothing very useful in my bag - just a single hairclip.
It was a pot of maple syrup.
It was the old inner tube from the bicycle which Rio had fished from the sea.
Three feet of slightly perished rubber. Bound to be useful for something.
It was the Jaguar stone which I'd found in London.It was the key to the museum display cabinet.
It was the set of manacles I'd removed from the little Indian's ankles.
It was the electronic marker which Bronson used with his theodolite.
It was an old English penny coin.
On one side was Britannia, managing to look both virginal and matronly.
On the other was the head of King George the Sixth looking much the same.
It was Bronson's plans for the hotel from Hell.
It was a short, hollow reed.
The poison dart was loosely lodged inside the reed.
It was Bronson's theodolite.
It was a very old bar of chocolate with a row of boys pictured on the wrapper.
It was Father Hubert's collar.
It was Rio's fishing net.
It was the quill I'd found in the Ketch museum.
It was the root which would cure Nico's snake bite.
It was a length of rope made of twisted and knotted vines.
It was the piece of rope which Renaldo had given to Miguel.

It was the beer bottle that slob of a watchman had dumped in the sea...
...now half full of filthy dock water.

It was a pancake, covered in maple syrup.
Might come in handy when the biscuits ran out.
The quill had been torn into small pieces.
It was the ball I stole from the cat.
They were George's shades.
It was a round of ammunition.



The cone was too big to put in the box.

The weight was in Imperial units.
It meant nothing to me.

The card also had my fortune on it: 'A family quarrel will turn out to your advantage.'
They were lovely underpants, really.
That wouldn't work.
It was the Coyote Stone.
Uh... non.
That was no good.
I don't think so.
Non.Come on, Collard!
Think!
That isn't it at all.

I was going to have to think of something else.
Non, that's wrong.
That's the kind of thing George would do. Not me.
Non, I'd have to think of something else.

NOT USED (See ds)DELETE-
That won't do.
He wanted me to press it for him.
It was the conch shell that Rio had given me.
The end of the reed was too narrow for the dart to fit into.
And very nicely pressed it was too.
The box was completely empty...
The box contained that little tequila worm.
The box contained the Mayan stone.
The box contained the poisoned dart.
The box contained the small statue I'd found in the warehouse.
The box contained Nico's lipstick.
The box contained a razor blade.
It was the small card on which the weighing machine had written its lies.
That wasn't right.
The box contained those awful panties Lobineau had sent to Nico.
The box contained my lucky piece of coal.
The box was bulging!
There's already something in the box.
I dropped the tequila worm into the empty box...
I put the Mayan stone in the empty box.
I dropped the poisoned dart into the box with just a little itch of misgiving...
I put the statue in the empty box.
I put the lipstick in the box.
I tucked the bright red panties in the empty box.
I put my lucky piece of coal in the empty box.
I didn't think that that was such a good idea.
The electronic marker was wrapped up in the net.

Who the HELL are YOU?
Joey? Is that YOU?
Oh, I remember you now.
Hey, listen - don't go near that HOLE!
NOBODY tells Robert FOSTER what to do, lady.
You don't UNDERSTAND! I've PLAYED this game BEFORE...
There's something... HORRIBLE in that hole, some BEAST with TENTACLES!
You're NUTS.
They don't make animations like THAT any more...

Hi. Lovely bread.Qu�?Bread - uh... 'pan'?Si. Pan.
Maybe I'll come back later when I'm hungry...
I didn't have anything else to ask her.
See you later!
Do you recognise this statue?�por Dios! Put it away! You will bring bad luck to Quaramonte!
Okay. I'm sorry.
That is Tezcatlipoca - the god of all that is evil!
Do you recognise the logo on this label?Kondor Transglobal? Yes, I've seen it before somewhere...
Here in Quaramonte?Maybe... but it could have been on T.V. - I don't remember.
Go away! You carry the curse of Tezcatlipoca!
Okay! I know when I'm not wanted...
I'd got as much out of that woman as I was going to...

That guy just didn't look like he was going to help me...
Hi there! What've you got for sale?�qu�?I said, what've you got... oh, never mind.

That guy wasn't interested in anything except cabbages...
You changed your mind.
You wanna buy cabbages after all.
How many you want? Two? Three?
None.
Don't come crying to me if you die of scurvy...
Hi.
You wanna buy something?
No, not really.
I got cabbages.
Buy a cabbage, se�or...I don't think so. I didn't come all this way to buy vegetables.
Listen - have you heard of Kondor Transglobal?
No. Buy a cabbage. I'll give you discount on bulk purchases.I'm not into cabbages!
He wasn't going to be any help.See ya...Have you ever seen anything like this before?
Aie! Tezcatlipoca!Put it away, se�or!Tezcatlipoca brings nothing but evil!
The poor guy was so freaked he didn't even mention his cabbages...

A clump of reeds grew out of the stinking swamp.
It was a clump of reeds.
It was a stagnant swamp.
Nothing - I mean, nothing - would possess me to step into that swamp.
Oh, no. I wasn't going in there.
I'd seen it done in movies - the hero eludes his foe by hiding underwater...
...breathing through a hollow reed until it's safe to come out.

I was glad I didn't have a foe to elude.
Uh - uh.One reed was enough....No way was I going through that swamp to reach the reeds.
Uh?I could have sworn this path...
What I wouldn't give for a map of this place.
All the paths looked the same.
Now I was completely lost.
I was going round in circles.
The path almost certainly lead somewhere I'd already been.
It looked just the same as every other path.One of these paths had to lead out of the forest...
The path lead back up to the cliff top.Another tree-lined path leading to more trees and paths...
That path looked like the one I'd just come along...
That path looked familiar, but then they all did...

Just a bird... Probably a parrot. Or some prehistoric reptile with wings like leather sacks...
Pull yourself together, Stobbart!
Get a grip on yourself.
There was something in that hole beneath the rock...
As soon as I stooped to investigate the hole, its inhabitant disappeared into the darkness.
The creature disappeared again, but I caught a glimpse of something small and furry...
Now I knew what was living in there - a long-toothed, snarling, furry wild thing.
Whatever it was, it sure sounded hungry.
I wished I had some 'Gourmet Dog' biscuits to feed it.
It was home to something with more teeth than kind thoughts in its head.
I wasn't about to try that again - I'm way too attached to my fingers.
The end of the reed had been neatly bitten off.


Do you know where I could find a detonator?
Sure - the cupboard behind the boss, but she won't let you have it.
I'll use my charm.
This I gotta see...
Do you know anything about Kondor Transglobal?
No, I never heard of it and I'm trying to work.
Okay, okay!
Ever heard of a guy called Karzac?Can't you see I'm busy?
He wouldn't want it.
There was nothing else I wanted to ask the guy.
If I don't finish this stock report the boss will be mad as hell!
Are you looking forward to the eclipse of the sun?
Not especially. Are you?I don't know. I've never seen one.
All I know about eclipses is that you shouldn't try to view them with the naked eye.
Please - go away and let me get on with my work...?

What was that?
Coal! I would have preferred chocolate.
Any flavour, so long as it hasn't got marzipan in it.
God, I hate marzipan!You can talk! I mean - you're a talking goat?
Keep your voice down! This is between you and me, right?
I guess so...I mean it! Tell anyone you've spoken to me and you'll be cursed!
It's a lump of lucky coal.
