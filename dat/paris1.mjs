Well, well. This is a surprise, Georgie...It was the stone they were after.
And now his butler has kidnapped her. And he tried to kill me.

DIALOGUE GEORGE & ANDRÈ
    Hi - André?
    Who is this?
    It's George Stobbart - Nico's boyfriend?
    Don't you mean 'ex-boyfriend'?
    Look - I didn't call you just to pick a fight...
    I need to talk to you. About Nico...
    Can't you accept she's just not interested in you?
    Listen, André - we need to talk. Nico's life depends on it.
    Okay... You remember the café at Montfauçon?
    Sure.;André...?;You'd better show, you creep...;I felt an irrational urge to wipe my ear...


I had a choice of destinations - the caf� at Montfau�on or the art gallery...
