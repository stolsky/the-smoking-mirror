I was sure Titipoco wasn't pointing at that barrel.
The water would have cooled the stone if I could figure out a way of getting it into the barrel...
The barrel was empty.
I just didn't have the strength to tip that barrel.
George! Where are you?
That barrel would have looked great on my patio, filled with shrubs.There was nothing in the barrel.It was a small drinking vessel made from some kind of gourd.That cup was no use to me. It had a hole in it.It was a smashed lantern - probably the cause of this destruction.I didn't need the lantern since it was still daylight. Besides, it was broken.The barrel was too heavy to move.It was Titipoco. I still hadn't forgiven him for knocking me out with his poisoned dart.It was the coyote stone! The original stone that I found in Paris!It was a very hot and blackened stone.I recognise that! It's the coyote stone!It was too hot to pick up.The ground was covered with ashes.Ashes... The thought that they might be human chilled me to the bone.One thing I was sure of: those underpants weren't George's.Maybe George can make use of these...There was nothing else I could do with the barrel.These sunglasses are George's!I thought about washing the underpants, but I didn't have any washing powder.Washing the underpants in the drinking water would have been a gross thing to do.The underpants weren't thick enough to protect my hands.I returned to Quaramonte and found that George had left a message with Conchita.Titipoco was pointing to a path which led out of the village.He'd already left for the Indian village so I hurried to catch up with him.When I arrived I found a scene of desolation...


Bonjour, I wonder if you could help me?
Ohayogozaimasu! Hee, hee, hee, hee!What's so funny? Hee, hee, hee, hee!
Never mind.I doubted the girls would be any help to me.Hi, girls! Hee, hee, hee, hee!
What's the joke? Hee, hee, hee, hee!
Okay. Fine.
If I wanted to be laughed at, there was always Nico.

SURPRISE!What the...!? Who are you?I'm Emily!What were you doing in there, Emily?Hiding. What are you doing here?Grown-up's stuff.Grown-ups? Pffft! I'm never going to grow up, I'm not!You shouldn't be here. What's your name?I'm George.Pleased t' meetcha, Jaws.George!That must be it! Ketch's treasure island!Uh-oh!That's Zombie Island! It's a bad place.No kidding? Well, bad place or not, that's my next port of call...Can I come too?The hell you can.I never get to leave the house.Why don't you run along and play?Aunt Mina told me 'stay out of mischief!'That doesn't mean you have to stay in doors, does it?On a beautiful day like today?There's a storm coming. Aw, nuts! You don't know that!I do so! I can see the whole world from the window.Yeah, well - like I said, I'm busy.Whatcha doin', Jaws?Whatcha doin' now, Jaws?Knock if off, will you?There's something you ought to know - I don't buy 'cute' or 'lost puppy'.There were several things I wanted to say to that awful kid, but I held my tongue...I'm putting this old map on the desk.What you doin' that for, Jaws?Because it was obviously intended to fit in this recessed area.How'd ya work that out?It's obvious.I bet you can't keep this piece of coal in your mouth for the next half hour...I'm just borrowing this feather, that's all.Why?I might be able to make use of it.You gonna steal it? That's bad. I'm gonna tell on you.No - don't do that.Why not?Because I'm not stealing - just borrowing.I've put the feather back. Are you happy now?Don't you want to steal it any more?For the last time, I didn't steal it.That's your word against mine, and I'm the one with the dimples.I've put your cross in this little hole in the desk.Why?Impulse, mainly, with a dash of irrational intuition.Silly! Only women have intuition!What can you tell me about Captain Ketch?That's him on the wall, in the picture.Yeah, I know. Scary looking guy, huh?He was my great-great-great-great grandfather.Yeah... you have his eyes.Yeah? Boy, that's interesting.He was a sailor captain. This is his house.Why don't you go play with Rio?I'm not allowed.How come?'Cos Aunt Frost says I'm not allowed out of the house, tha's why, Mister Nosey-Beak.Too bad.Why don't you ask your other Aunt if you can play with Rio?Aunt Mina's cuckoo. Aunt Frost says so.She says when the Lord handed out common sense, Aunt Mina was off getting double portions of chin.Could too. I could keep it in my mouth for hours and hours and hours.Yeah? Go on then - prove it.Don't want to. And if you try to make me, I'll tell Aunt Mina.She wouldn't have been interested...'Cos I have the insatiable curiosity of the young.Why?--That Rio is a smart kid. He helped me outwit Bronson.Rio is clever. He can spit ever so far!Would you like one of these biscuits?Ugh! Those are dog biscuits!So what?They'll give you dog-breath! Stinky dog-breath!You know, I don't care?---Whatcha doin' now?Grown up stuff.Look - an ancient Mayan stoneIs that a magic stone?Well, I don't know about that.Oh.That cross you're wearing, Emily...It's my lucky Jesus cross.It's just like the one Captain Ketch wore...Uh-huh?Can I borrow it?Uh-uh.What would you trade for that cross, Emily?A puppy!Well, I don't happen to have a puppy in my pocket right now...Can you think of anything else you'd trade?I don't know.Would you like to play darts?No.Aw, c'mon! I'll throw, you catch!That's dangerous. Darts will stick in me and make me bleed.--------Do you know how to use a theodolite?We don't learn anything about surveying at my school.Not until fifth grade.--------I've put the lantern in the inkwell. See? It fits.Why?Because it was cut to fit.Why?Because sneaky old Captain Ketch made it that way.Why?What is with all the questions?'Cos I'm interested.Why?--All right. Truce.--I doubt that!Before you ask...Here, I've got a conch. Would you like it?Dunno. Aunt Frost told me to never take presents from strange men.I'm not a strange man!Then why are you called 'Jaws', Jaws? That's a stupid name.I'm not called... Look. Conch. Pretty. Swap for the cross. Yes or no?Uh...Right, this thing's going out of the window.Okay. We'll do swapsies.Jaws!Jeez!Make your mind up.lText Resource 1576�y����


There's a fish, my man.I can't put it in my pocket while it's flapping about like that!No problem.Hi! Is this Ketch's Landing?Yeah, man.Hi.You wanna buy some fish?I don't like fish. What's your name?There was nothing else I wanted to ask the boy.What do you need to catch a tiger fish?Rio. It means 'River'. What about you?George. It means... uh... well, it's just a name.I think Bronson is trying to cheat those sweet, vulnerable old ladies!That's a little unfair, ain't it?Okay - he's trying to cheat those seriously demented, poisonous old ladies!You have to admire his acumen.So why did you throw the fish at Bronson?The creep wouldn't shut up about Emily. Told the old ladies stories about me.Tell me what you know about Bronson and I'll straighten things out with the old ladies.How you gonna do that?I'll talk to them.They won't believe you, man. They think the sun shines out of Bronson's bottom.Yeah, so does Bronson.Are you sure Bronson's such a bad guy, kid?All he wants to do is reopen the museum You ever hear of a museum with a swimming pool...?A pool?Yeah. Right next to the Pirate Galleon Funhouse complex.I've seen it on Bronson's plans.Tell me more about Bronson's plans.He gonna pull down the old house!Pull it down? What for?Not enough bedrooms.How many does he want?Thirty-six, each with a private Jacuzzi...It's a hotel!That's what I thought, but I didn't want to jump to conclusions.One of those real fancy flies like the rich fishermen use.Yeah? Why's that?Will you help me get those plans?I don't want to go nowhere near that man.He promised to drown me when he found the fish I'd left in his sleeping bag.Can you let me have a fish, kid?You said you don't like fish.It's not for me. It's a present.For the old ladies? Well, it makes a change from flowers and candy...No, it's for their cat.It could take some time...No luck with the fish?Nah. They don't want bite. That's 'cos they know there's a storm brewing.Storm? I don't think so.Hey - I got a bite!You have? It's a big one! A real big one! Reel him in, Rio! Jeez - it must be a whale or something...Rustiest whale I ever see...I still need a fish, Rio.Okay. Make me try again.Maybe you'd better change your bait...-Tell me about your friend Emily...Emily Ketch? A descendant of Captain Ketch, the pirate?Yeah.It doesn't bother you?Why should it? We don't responsible for our ancestors.That Emily sure asks a lot of questions!You still want to go?Is it true that Captain Ketch lived around here?That's right. That's his house, up on the hill. It's a museum now.Yeah, I know. The old ladies told me so.Yeah? That's exactly what I need! Thanks, kid.You won't get inside, y'know. The old ladies closed it down.What do you know about Captain Ketch?Could I borrow your net?Yeah, man. No problem.You planning on catching some fish?No. I'm after a big rock...No school today?No, sir.What about your education?I can fish, sail and swim, I've been looking after myself since I was six, and I'm bi-lingual.Aren't you a little over-qualified for a beach bum?Well y'know, there's a lot of competition.How come the old ladies closed the museum?It's Bronson's doing.They'll regret it though. That guy's a crook!Oh, I know all about Mr Bronson's plans...!I've got to warn the old ladies about Bronson before it's too late!They won't believe you.You could be right. But how can I convince them?Steal the plans.Do you know anything about pirate treasure?Man, that's all stories. There's no such thing as real pirate treasure.Would you take me to, uh... Zombie Island?In this weather? You're mad, man.The rain will keep the zombies indoors...Just say I did meet a zombie... what would you do?There ain't no zombies on Zombie Island, least not any more. It's uninhabited.Good.What do you mean - not any more?Is this worm worth a fish?Could be good bait. How'd it die?I think it drowned in tequila.Yeah. But I promised it to my sister. She well vexed with me.Why is your sister mad with you?I guess.Well I ain't had no luck with them tiger fish.What can I do with an old inner tube?I know what I'd do. I'd make the biggest catapult you'd ever seen......an' use it to smack Bronson with a fish from a safe distance.Those ballistic fish shenanigans of yours are going to get you in deep trouble some day.Why you so interested in Emily Ketch?Oh, hold on just a minute.The marker was no use without the theodolite so I went back and got it.Okay, Rio. Let's go!Well, here I go. Wish me luck, Rio.Good luck, George. Watch out for the walking dead.Usually because you're standing next to it.Okay, what do I get out of it?Do you know anything about a forthcoming eclipse?No, but that explains why the weather's about to get real bad...Rio - it's a beautiful day. There's no more than a whisker of cloud in the sky.Well, last night when I got home with our supper she went wild!Rio, she says, how come all you ever catch is puffa fish? I sick of puffa fish!What I want is tiger fish, and don't you come back home 'til you catch one, boy!Believe me - it's soon going to get real bad...Look here - Bronson's plans.Was I right? Is that creep up to no good?Darn right he is!I can pay you. I've got Quaramontean dollars, French francs and travellers' cheques.You must be joking -  the nearest bank is three islands away.Just like my uncle Gabriel. Yeah, I'll have that.Will you give me a fish if I give you this, um, crayon? You can do some great pictures with this!What do you give to a small, irritating girl who asks about everything?I don't see how I'm gonna catch no tiger fish. All I have is a fishing pole and a worm!What's a quill?Try a conch; delicate colours, interesting shape and when you put it to your ear, you can hear the sea.I need another fish, Rio.It's what people used to write with in Captain Ketch's days.Crayon? That's Rapouche Number 24 lipstick! New this season!You know a lot about it.You'd be amazed how many fashion photoshoots we get around here.Do you want it?Nah, those supermodels are always giving me this kind of stuff for my sister.Sure! My sister will love that!Will you give me a fish if I give you these... these... uh...Rio, are these ugly, tasteless, nylon panties worth a fish?So this was Zombie Island.Somehow I'd been expecting something more sinister...C'mon, Rio, let's find that treasure.No thanks. I'm staying right here.No, man.Hey, I know a girl on the next island who'd go crazy for those!Oh, come on! You said yourself there's no zombies left.Yeah, but that was while there was a big pile of sea water between me and this place.All me have left now is this little bit between the boat and the shore and I'm hanging onto it.-Nah. I'd sooner be fishing.Any use for a quill?-Yeah, me'll take 'em.Okay, I'll get you a fish. It might take a while, though.Rest it, man. This whole Emily thing just isn't funny.Look, we're obviously at cross purposes here, I'm talking about Emily Ketch.Yeah, and so am I. She was my friend. Her aunts hated it but we did move together, y'know.She used to be real keen at hide n' seek. It could take hours to find her.One time, the last time, it took days.Thanks! Let's hope them tiger fish hungry.A deal's a deal.  Here's the conch.Where had she hidden herself?Suddenly, I didn't feel so good.No! It can't be!But it was. My lucky piece of coal.Rio, how far away is Ketch's Landing from here?Best part of ten miles. Why?She must have shouted and screamed herself hoarse but there was nobody to hear her...And with the mood my sister is in, I'd be safer with the zombies.Ten miles?That catapult must have been a lot more powerful than I thought.What would you give me for this fine, red ball?-Captain Ketch's old sea chest.The only way to open it was from the outside...There's a very nasty Arabic insult I could teach you...?Forget it.The guy with the theodolite?We never exchanged another word about Emily Ketch.--Who are these old ladies you mentioned?Miss Frost and Miss Mina Ketch.He's got plans for redeveloping the museum.What's that you've got?I didn't think the kid would be interested in that...-Just what everybody knows around here. He was a pirate and get himself hung.Did you see the weird sisters come by here?Did I! They looked madder than usual so I hid until they'd gone by.Just as well. They thought you were playing with Emily. Boy! Were they steamed!Emily? You're madder than them.Cool! Have you got one?Hey, this is just what you need to make a fly!-I couldn't see why Rio would want the shredded quill.lText Resource 1777d>Qp��-5Zs����4`����<Bu���A�����,����V�����f���		/	w	�	�	�	�	&


Woah! Don't shoot!
The little guy had a blowpipe.
That confirmed my suspicions about what had happened to Nico.
I waited for him to shoot me but it didn't happen.
Instead he seemed to want to tell me something.Uh!What? What do you want?
Uh! Uh!
He seemed excited, almost desperate.What did he want so bad?What? You want me to get out?Nope, that wasn't it. What did he want?The little Indian fella wasn't about to let me past.Uh! Quaramonte!Not until he'd got what he wanted, whatever that was.Is that where you're from? Quaramonte City?Uh - uh! Quaramonte! Quaramonte!Who did this? That big thug?Okay, okay!What happened here? Are you responsible for this...?Titipoco - I have an important job for you. Take this rope to the top of this scaffolding...Rope!I had nothing else I wanted to ask the little guy.You little asshole...!Titipoco, any ideas what I can do with this rope?Titipoco. When I tell you, I want you to copy what I am doing.Copy......so I thought, 'This is it', y'know? 'This is true love.'Anyway, I have to leave for a few weeks and when I come back, what do I find?Uh!Damn right! And with who? Lobineau! The creep.Um - ha!Yeah, that's exactly what I thought.Oh, heck. Looks like another dead end, Titipoco. Any ideas?I was hoping for something more constructive. Never mind, I'll have a look around.Nothing's happened! I hate that. Don't you hate that?Aaaaaaah.....!Titipoco? Oh, my...Woaaaaaaaa..!Look, I need to light this torch.Can you do something clever with a couple of sticks or flint and tinder or......or a cheesy novelty cigarette lighter, as it turned out.Uh-uh.Where's George?George has been here, right?He was pointing to the smouldering remains of a hut....and throw it over the top.Titipoco - do you still have that lighter gun you pulled on me so amusingly?These are George's shades, right? Has he been here?Unh! Jaws!Where is he now?What's that? It looks like the stone we brought from Paris - but it's different...Yes - it's has a carving of an eagle!That clinches it. George must have found this stone in the Caribbean...I hoped to god that George was all right...Hey, shortie! Make yourself useful and help me with this barrel!Thanks.Uh.He was pointing to the remains of a burned out hut...What is it? Where are you pointing?This was the dart you used to knock out my girlfriend.If she has come to any harm, I will count you personally responsible.Lotze-cap, pey-too, fnord.Hi! I'm not going to hurt you...Quaramonte!Is that your name? Quaramonte?Uh! Quaramonte!His vocabulary seemed a little restricted...What have you done with my girlfriend?Uh.I'm not leaving without her! Where is she?He didn't appear to understand me...Tell me what you've done with Nico and I'll share these biscuits with you!I knew it sounded lame, trying to bargain with a box of doggie snacks.Besides, how was he to know how yummy they tasted?Do you know what this is?Pey-too! Lotze-cap, pey-too. In Yacot'la gohina mutoo!Hmm.What does this key unlock?Uh?Hey! You're manacled!I'm going to set you free, okay?Hey, come back here!The little guy had gone to ground amongst the stack of crates.I didn't think he'd be interested.Titipoco! I'm almost glad to see you...And where's George? Have you seen him?He wouldn't have wanted it.He just looked at me. If anybody was going to come up with a plan, it was going to have to be me.There was nothing I wanted to ask him.Would you like some chocolate, Titipoco? It's a good vintage.Um-ha? Urgh bleh!You're smarter than you look.How did you hook up with a maniac like Karzac in the first place?Karzac? 'Whoop whoop loco'.Yes, he scares me too....and managed to hide the stone when the village was attacked by Karzac's men!I had the coyote and jaguar stones, Titipoco had the eagle...According to the shaman, that's all we needed to deal with Tezcatlipoca.Pity he hadn't had any ideas for dealing with Karzac...lText Resource 3258�dlqy��������� 38JOT[bmsx��������*=CHT]dmtz}�������9INSZbiuz���������	C	^	�	�	�	�	�	



The room had been decorated to resemble the interior of a sailing ship.
It was disturbingly effective. It was an old wooden barrel.Maybe it was from Ketch's ship!Whatever lived in that barrel could stay there as far as I was concerned.Yow!I should have known better than to put my hand in there.Grandma Stobbart had a nasty experience in a water butt once.It was a ship's bell. Two bells and all's well!Pirates were cool. It was an actual pirates' ship chart!Okay, I've had my hands on an historical document. Now what?It was Captain Ketch's sea chest.Its battered appearance hinted at salty tales of maritime adventure and swashbuckling...Long months at sea with a rum-sodden mutinous crew, hard tack and scurvy!And this chest, full to the brim with Ketch's loot: pearls, diamonds, emeralds and doubloons...On the other hand, it could have been full of spare blankets.Hmm...It was a shiny and very sharp-looking pirate's cutlass.It would have been easy to reach the cutlass and slip it in my pocket...It would also have been the most regrettable action of my life.The top surface of the desk had a large recessed area set into it.I guessed it was intended to stop things rolling off in heavy seas...There was also an ink well and, a few inches away, a small hole with a feather placed in it.The little girl had cute freckles, a cute little nose and the eyes of a KGB interrogator.Around her neck was a large cross on a chain.It was identical to the one in the portrait of Captain Ketch!Fine, as long she didn't try to convert me!It was an indented well in the corner of the desk.I guess it was intended to hold ink, but it seemed unnecessarily wide.Maybe Ketch had used it to hold his rum bottles steady in heavy seas...The base of the lantern fitted precisely in the ink well.It was a neat oil lantern made of brass.Holding that lantern I felt kinda biblical, like Jesus or... or Florence Nightingale.It was the holder for the quill.Ketch's cross was jammed into the pen holder.I wasn't going to take the cross out of the holder. Somehow I just knew that was where it was supposed to be...It was firmly attached to the desk.It was one of those old pens made out of a feather.That might come in useful in ticklish situations...'Captain Frederick Ketch, 1570.'Around his neck was a cross.Maybe he was a part-time pirate.It was identical to the one the little girl was wearing!It was the portrait of Captain Ketch.The portrait might have made a nice souvenir, but it was too large to carry.It was an old book with spidery writing covering the open pages.It was Ketch's log book.'March 20, Fixteen hundred and feventy fix. Engaged frigate off Fan Falvador.'It was garbage! I guess being a pirate didn't require too many academic qualifications...The passage went on to describe how Ketch had got wind of the approach of a fleet of English ships.It seemed the new Governor had not shared his predecessor's views on Ketch's activities. They were out for his blood!...and the shadow fell on... a patch of desk top. Nothing special at all.'Sailed to that place where I made secure my fortune.''I returned, safe in the knowledge that the Governor shall not discover that which I had hidden.''For is it not writ that 'tis easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle.' Hmm...It was a beautifully crafted model of a sailing ship.The ship looked too fragile to touch.Maybe that wheel was from Ketch's ship! Suddenly, I was twelve years old again.Hard a' port, bo'sun! Aye, aye, Cap'n Stobbart!She canna take it, cap'n! M' lad's dead! Abandon ship!The chart fitted exactly into the recess on the top of the desk.The lantern fitted so precisely in the ink well it could only be deliberate.Ketch's cross slipped snugly into the pen holder.The lantern cast a strong light over the desk top,... ...the light cast a shadow of the cross......and the shadow fell precisely over a small, unnamed island - shaped like a skull.It was Emily - short, cute and irritating to know.That was the way out to the front of the house.There was also an ink well and the small hole where the quill had been.The desk had obviously been cut to fit the chart. Or maybe vice versa.That looked like that's where it was supposed to be so I left it there.lText Resource 2283TW^fkpx���������',4:_



Professor Oubier?Yes? Who are you?Hi Duane - just a moment. I have a few questions to ask the Professor here...My name is Stobbart - George Stobbart.I thought that face was familiar! Remember me, George? Duane Henderson?Do you know where I can find the offices of Kondor Transglobal?What's your interest in the eclipse, professor?Oh, it's purely a layman's curiosity. History's my subject, not astronomy!But I've been fascinated by the movements of the heavenly bodies since I was a child.I wouldn't miss a total eclipse for the world!Does the eclipse have some special significance for you?For me, no. For the ancient Mayans, it marked the end of the fifth age.Perhaps we should be celebrating...Ah, no. The end of each age heralds destruction on a global scale.The fifth is the final age - ending in the total destruction of the earth!Oh, yes. Tezcatlipoca. The Lord of Darkness.That's my business.I have proof that you're directly involved with Kondor.I used them as shippers to transport artefacts to a gallery in Paris.I had nothing else to ask him just then.---Does the name Karzac mean anything to you?Yes, I know him. In fact, if it wasn't for Karzac, I wouldn't be here!What?He's financing my expedition.The company no longer exists. They went bankrupt recently.Beyond that I have no connection with the company which, as I said, no longer exists.But I intend to return to Quaramonte in plenty of time.A Central American god, right?A supreme deity. Tezcatlipoca means, literally: 'smoking mirror'.There - you see the mirror shield in his left hand?The Mayans believed he could look into the mirror and see into the hearts of men.Tell me about your wife, Professor.Please. I... I don't want to talk about her.Maybe you don't, but I do.Why was she known as the Little Dachshund?It was just a silly pet name I used to call her...Somehow, some damned reporter found out.You shot her, didn't you?No! I loved Carol. She meant the world to me!Okay. I understand.What do you know about my girlfriend's abduction?I don't know what you are talking about.She was invited to your mansion in Paris...Not by me, she wasn't. I haven't been home for nearly seven months. He was the wind which came howling in the night in search of victims...What are you doing in Quaramonte, professor?Seeking Mayan artefacts.Central American history has been my life's work.Have you ever employed a Central American butler or servant?I've never employed any kind of servant, monsieur!Sure I do!Would you like a biscuit?No, thank you.You should - they're good!I can't get enough of these things!And victims they gave him, by the thousand!Human sacrifices?Men, women, children, animals - anything that bled.The steps of his Temple ran red with the blood of sacrifices.The Mayans have a legend that says he'll return one day. I hope I'm not around to see it!---This here's my pal Bertrand. He's an archaeologist.Can you tell me anything about this stone?Where did you get that?-This is the stone my girlfriend called you about.The stone that nearly cost Nico her life!I assure you, I don't know what you're talking about.How much do you want for it?It's not for sale.-Pleased to meet you.--Can you identify this statue, professor?What do you make of this statue?------Do you see this label?Yes - it refers to a company named Kondor. What of it?I traced that company here to Quaramonte.Do you know anything about this eclipse, professor?Of course! It's not the reason I'm here in Quaramonte, but I'm looking forward to seeing it all the same!-----Take a look at this, professor...What have you got to say about that?Where did you get this?Never mind that - how do you explain these withdrawals?I left my financial affairs in the hands of my secretary.Including the withdrawal of funds, in cash, from your personal account?I trust Gwynneth implicitly.And why Marseilles? Why the very place my girlfriend was taken?That's obvious, Stobbart. We are both victims of the same devious plot.What plot?I have no idea.France, eh...?Yes. I believe that's where you live, professor?I have a house there, on the outskirts of Paris, but I haven't been back for many months.-We meet again...Ma'amselle...What can you tell me about the jaguar stone, professor?It's obsidian, from the Chichen-Itza region.I thought you were going to stay in Quaramonte to witness the eclipse?Alas - business comes first! An important consignment of artefacts on loan to the British Museum...I want to warn you about Karzac.Really? My dear girl, there's nothing you can tell me about Karzac I don't already know.You're surprised I teamed up with him? An astute step on my behalf, even if I say so myself.His money has enabled me to continue my important archaeological research.-It doesn't matter...Au revoir, professor...Goodbye, ma'amselle.lText Resource 2315`���#L��_iu��	+/@J{��(3,�������Do you keep detonators in the office?I don't know.

It's a soccer team, isn't it?The Kondor I'm looking for is an international shipping company!Yes.Ever hear of a guy called Karzac?No.I thought again.You have?There was nothing else I wanted to ask that guy.Do you know anything about the eclipse?Yes, and I'm really looking forward to seeing it.I heard it's going to be pretty spectacular...It's in a few weeks time, isn't it?Nine days.Thanks.lText Resource 2316QU���B���&(]���,>n�������I�������������Hi!Good afternoon and welcome to Consolidated Mining.How come you're not wearing your pants?I feel more alert without them. Kind of perky.If you are planning to stay in Quaramonte City may I recommend the Consolidated Mining Experience?An interactive hands-on tour of one of our deepest mines, with talking tour guides available in three different languages?He wouldn't be interested...A tour of a mine?Well, this is a mining company. What else did you expect?-I guess a mining company must use explosives, right?Not in the accounts and ledger section, to my knowledge.Have you heard of a company called Kondor Transglobal?No, se�or.Do you know where I could find Se�or Karzac?No, se�or.And your boss doesn't mind?She suggested it.There was nothing else I wanted to ask the guy.Do you know anything about the eclipse that's due soon?Me? No, se�or.


Drop the gun or I shoot!
Please! Don't hurt me!
Who's the guy with the hat and the fat cigar?
My mother.I've done just as I have been instructed, professor.
With the mine closed down there'll be no-one around to observe your excavation.
Whoever he is.
Just remember what I told you, General!
There's really no need to make a martyr out of that man...
What do you think of these panties, General?I'm sorry to keep you waiting, se�or. Welcome to Quaramonte!Thanks. My name's George Stobbart, from California.But what is this? An angel, come down to earth?Nicole Collard. Enchant�, mon G�n�ral.Pardon me, se�orita, but I couldn't help myself.He would have had no interest.We picked it up in the market. As a souvenir.Oh, boy! Fabuloso!They're yours if you'll tell me all you know about Karzac...Look - we'd like to ask you a few questions...You've come to the right place, se�or.Tourist information - General Grasiento, at your service!Karzac? I never heard of him.I told you - I never heard of the guy.Where are they? The eclipse is about to happen!Patience. Your mother will be here soon and Karzac will be close behind.Just keep the Yankee covered and leave the worrying to others.Yeah, Raoul...The maniacs were going to sacrifice George!Thankfully George was the only one to notice me.What is Oubier doing in Quaramonte?Researching our rich and glorious past, se�or!The musicians out in the square say that a ship flying the Kondor flag was berthed here.They are simple peasants.They will go along with anything you say in the hope of parting you from your money.Shut up, Stobbart. Just... shut up!I bet I'm not the only one due for the chop around here either. Eh, Raoul?Are you sure you never heard of Kondor?Oh, yes.The company is registered here in Quaramonte City.You are mistaken, se�orita.I believe Kondor is run by a man named Karzac.Kondor is run by Karzac, isn't it?Wrong again, se�or. Karzac has nothing to do with anything called Kondor.Ah! I have visitors...Do you keep a record of companies registered in Quaramonte?Of course, se�orita. Unfortunately all the records were destroyed by a flash flood.Have you heard of a guy called Karzac?No. No - I never heard of him.The lady at the mining company told us a ship belonging to Kondor was here recently.Conchita Garcia is crazy. If there had been a ship, do you think I wouldn't have noticed?The professor is planning an expedition to some Mayan ruins.He came to see me to get an excavation permit.Calm down. He's no threat.Hey, Raoul. Why don't you do us both a favour and shoot Pablo?You're very funny, Stobbart. I haven't forgotten Marseilles....naked.When Karzac cuts your heart out, I'll be the one laughing.I hear there was an accident at the mine, a few months ago.That's correct.A lot of men killed, weren't there?A few...Thirty?Pah! Barely one percent of the working population!Do you have a map of Quaramonte?Do I get the panties now? I told you all I know...!Raoul was a bundle of raw nerves. I hoped George wouldn't push him too far.You told me nothing.I'm warning you..!My girl friend has a favour she wants to ask you, General.For you, my dear... anything!I've changed my mind.Oh no, you haven't. She's embarrassed about asking you for an interview, General.An interview? With ME? Fabuloso!Well, I, uh... I want to write a story about you.A map...? I'm sorry, se�or, but I don't.You hear that, Renaldo? An exclusive glossy spread about your beloved General!Si, Se�or General.Look after things here. I'm going back to my apartment and I don't want to be disturbed...I'll get you for this, George Stobbart!Don't worry - if you're gone for more than a couple of hours I'll come and get you.Who was the guy you were talking to when we arrived?Professor Oubier - a visitor, se�or, like yourselves.Did you say Oubier?Si, se�or. Professor Oubier, a French archaeologist.Are there any ruins around the City?We've had enough of Quaramonte and we want out.Am I stopping you?The guy at the docks tells me I need an exit visa.Would you like a biscuit?Have you ever seen anything like this before?Ask Renaldo. He'll make the arrangements. That's what he's here for.That's a native carving, isn't it? Where did you get it?Take a look at this label...Si, se�or. 'Kondor Transglobal'.Can you tell me where to find their offices?No, se�or. I never heard of them and neither did Renaldo.What about that one on the wall?Ah... That is an archaeological survey map, se�or. Not suitable for tourists.I'd asked him all I wanted to for now...I'll be back...Of course, se�or! Quaramonte has everything!This is the tourist office? It says 'Police' on the sign outside.It is both, se�or. I am a man of many parts!I can see that, General.I have a friend who wants to visit a historical site.Are you trying to bribe me?Every man has his price...Mine is more than a dog cookie, Se�or Stobbart.Renaldo will only be too pleased to conduct a guided tour......when he's dealt with today's paperwork, of course.I'd run out of things to talk about...Oh!Do you know anything about the forthcoming eclipse, General?Such things do not interest me, se�or.Is it true there's a restriction on music in Quaramonte?Yes, there is. An emergency measure, introduced by Nuestra Se�ora.--Folk music is a link with the past for some of these people.Take away their musical roots and what have they got left?Easy Listening.You think Easy Listening could replace a musical heritage hundreds of years old?Why not? It happened in your country.Se�or...!I was just curious. You will recall, se�or, that curiosity killed the cat. Yeah, but that's just an expression. So. Here we are. Se�or...!Sorry, I forgot.-You've changed!A couple of hours..!Don't worry yourself, my finger isn't loaded.Is that a lava lamp?Sure! It's more impressive in the dark. I'll close the blinds!No! No, don't do that, not on such a beautiful day...-That's an impressive hi-fi system, General.Would you care to hear some music, my dear?Uh... no.Oh, it's no bother. I don't even have to get up...Big fish. Catch it yourself?Catch it? Ha! Fishing poles are for children!Then how did...? Are those bullet holes? Two magazines on full automatic. It put up quite a fight.I, uh, love your TV.Oh, yeah. Cool, no?Oh, boy! Female mud-wrestling!That tigerskin, you didn't kill it yourself, did you? Alas, no. I had to import a synthetic one from the United States.-Nico? What are you doing here?-It is very comfortable to lie on...-Unfortunately, I'm allergic to man made fibres.I thought I would slip into something more comfortable.The stench of cheap cologne rolled over me like tear gas.------So, what do you want to know about me?Ask, and I will answer. I will deny you... nothing.--I am a very giving person.How nice for your friends.-Your eyes are glittering like stars...His damn cologne was making my eyes water.I was running out of sofa.As spirited as you are beautiful! I admire that.As long as he admired it from afar.Mom!What is going on here?Uh, nothing, mom. I was...Ah, ah, ah! I'm in uniform. And when I'm in uniform, it's...Madam la Presidenta. Sorry... Madam la Presidenta.Now - what is going on here?Nothing, Madam la Presidenta. I was just showing my friend Nico some of the cool stuff I've got.Hi.Good afternoon, se�orita. And just what are your intentions towards my son?Intentions? We were just talking.How nice. She has good bone structure, Raoul. Has she any brains?-She's a reporter!Is she? And what sort of questions has she been asking?I'm a freelance photojournalist. I do lifestyle features.For what sort of magazines?Uh... "Hiya!", "Lifestyles of the Super Rich and Vainglorious", "Envy Magazine"...----Excellent. Raoul, you've chosen well for a change.It was pretty obvious who pulled the strings around here.It looked safest to play it dumb, with good bone structure.I hoped George was making good use of the time I was buying him.-Tell that to the firing squad.Leave that chart alone!Firstly I'm going to set George free and then screw up Karzac's scheme.No! I can't let you do that! Karzac has promised me power!Raoul, wake up. The only thing Karzac has on offer is death. You may want to ask Oubier...Except you can't. Karzac murdered him.You're lying! Oubier's in Europe.Sure he's in Europe. In London. On a mortuary slab with two bullet holes in him.But Karzac promised! When he frees Tezcatlipoca, we'll all be granted great power!-Listen to her, Raoul. Karzac's insane.I... I don't know. I need to think.You've let your mother do your thinking for you up to now. You need to think for yourself.Your mother and Karzac think alike. There's only one expendable member of the plan left and that's you.Mother would never betray me!Oh, I'm tired of trying to reason with you, Raoul. Titipoco?Watch this man and if he makes a move, shoot him with your... Gun.Hold still, George. I don't want to sacrifice you by accident.You have no idea how glad I am to see you.They were going to cut your heart out. I think I can guess.We can save the happy reunions for later. We've got to move. Come on!lText Resource 885����<u��)W��Kv��D���<b���$V��	m	�	�	�	



Hey - Mr Henderson! Good to see you again!
Do I know you, son?George Stobbart. Remember - in Syria? I sold you a statue...I remember that. Pearl was mighty vexed when the paint come off.Look, I'm sorry. I'll give you back the fifty dollars...No, no. You suckered me fair and square.It was Pearl's husband, Duane.I suddenly realised this was Duane Henderson - the guy I'd met in Syria last year.Now, how can I help you?I didn't think Duane would have any interest.He's the reason we're here! He kidnapped Nico and then tried to kill me!Bertrand? Hot dog!This truck is a rolling bomb! Four hundred pounds of nitrate fertilizer with a plastique initiator!Was that Pearl I saw hanging out around the corner?What do you think of these panties, Duane?Lord! Hot stuff, George! You buy those for your girl?Do you know anything about a shipping company called Kondor Transglobal?Sure I do. You have to get up pretty early to catch Duane with his pants down!Kondor Transglobal is all wound up. Seems my investigations scared them off...What? You beat me to it?Did you find any evidence of Kondor's drug smuggling operations?Drugs? Hell, no. Kondor was a cover for the illegal export of Mayan artefacts!So who was behind Kondor Transglobal?It was registered in the name of Eidan.Did you get the guy?I don't think he ever existed. Eidan backwards spells Nadie - Spanish for Nobody.Do you think the General was involved with Kondor?Hell, no - and if he's a General, I'm a Buddhist!He was a little confused about whether or not he really worked for the C.I.A.Since he wasn't too sure, neither was anyone else, including his wife Pearl.So the General is nothing but a puppet?He's like Pinocchio before he met the blue-rinse fairy - strictly strings and wood.Who's pulling the strings?His mother - better known as La Presidenta, the dictator.Does the name Karzac mean anything to you?Sounds like a comic book villain to me, son.He's the man behind Kondor and the rat who kidnapped Nico!You know, the first time I met you I was deeply impressed with your naive simplicity.I said to Pearl: if we'd ever had kids, I would have wanted a boy like George.Did you know that traditional music is illegal in Quaramonte?Is that so? Seems reasonable to me.No - really. The leader of the band in the square has been imprisoned just because of the music he played!I don't know who you've been talking to, but that fella, Miguel - he's an agitator!No - a guy we know in Paris bought them for her.Oh. You're a threesome, then?What's the real reason the musician was imprisoned?Handed out 'subversive literature' at the mines.That so-called General was waiting for Miguel when he got back into town.Marched him off to jail at gunpoint on a charge of incitin' a riot.Well, we did. She ain't speakin' to me.Why are you looking at me like that, George?Forget it.Why did you bring a huge truck like that?Aw, she got it into her head to go visit some ruins.I'd take her if it wasn't for two things.What?Do you know that man you were talking to, Mr Henderson?Sure. That was Bertrand, the archaeologist.That's right. What did he do to get your goat, George?That was Professor Oubier!I don't wanna and I ain't gonna.I never heard of it, son.Have you really never heard of Kondor?Of course I have, son. Matter of fact, it was Ol' Duane's investigations scared 'em off!But I underestimated you, son.No, that fella's just a mouthpiece for the real power in Quaramonte.I had nothing else to ask him.That's a lovely image, Duane. Never mind, I'll think of something.Did you drive all the way down here?Hell, no. Pearl did the drivin' while I followed the maps.Oh, uh... just camping equipment. Sleeping bags and tents.The way she handled the wheel  you'd think she'd bin truckin' half her life!What's in the truck, Duane?They'll hear the bang in China! Gee, I'm really looking forward to this!Hey, Duane. I want you to tie this rope to your truck, and then drive forward.I had no idea whether this really was going to work, but I'd seen it in a black and white Western...Of course, Hopalong was using a horse and Duane had a four ton truck but, hey! The principle's sound.This here is Bertrand.Hi. George Stobbart.Bertrand Oubier. So we finally caught up with you...What the devil are you talking about?Don't give me that crap, Oubier...Anything you say, George.--Now hold fire, George. Suppose you tell us what the hell's going on...?-This man lured Nico to his house in Paris in order to abduct her!Nonsense! I've been in Quaramonte for the last seven months.-And I can vouch for that. George, I think you owe Bertrand an apology...-Okay, Oubier, I'm sorry.--Would you like a biscuit, Duane?Oh, no. Those Gourmet Dog snacks bring me out in a rash.You've tried them?They were on special offer. Pearl bought a whole crate...When I asked her if she was thinking of keeping a dog too, she just laughed.--Would you like to borrow my lucky piece of coal, Duane?What's so lucky about it?Well, we made it to Quaramonte in one piece.When you've been here a few days you won't look on that as luck...------Are you still working for... 'You-Know-Who'?Who's that, George? You know I'm retired...When I'd last seen Duane he'd hinted that he worked for the C.I.A..Oh, nothing. Forget it - I confused you with somebody else.Oh, I do that all the time...Me and Pearl always hankered after a taste of the Great Outdoors.Aren't you worried about camping out in a tropical jungle?We had a trial run in West Virginia. This'll be a breeze in comparison.Yeah, that was her. Did she tell you about our fight?Why isn't Pearl speaking to you?I didn't speak to her.Well, right now she ain't speakin' to me!--How come you brought a truckload of explosives but no detonator?Call me old-fashioned, but I say packing trunks is women's work.I left the packing to Pearl, and I can't find a darned thing!Just hope she remembered to bring my denture polish.I'd sure hate to arrive back in the States with tar on my teeth.Here's the detonator, Duane.Keep your voice down, George! You want everyone to know?You know I can't talk about my work, George...That's between me and Uncle Sam.You'd best go and warn Miguel that the US cavalry's on the way!Okay.I spoke to Pearl earlier.Yeah? Did she mention that we've had a kinda falling out?No, she didn't.Yes, she did.She'll get over it.Hey! Pssst! Hey, George!--Duane Henderson! Boy, am I ever glad to see you!Get to the American consul and tell him I've been imprisoned without charge.Get real, George. He was the previous occupant of that cell you're in.We're going to have to use good old American know-how to get you out of there.Uh, oh.That, and this truck full of explosives I've got here.-----Duane!Duane! Listen to me! You'll kill all of us!You're such a nay sayer, George. It'll go like clockwork.Negative to negative, positive to positive. I guess.--Okay, just a minute. I've got to get to a safe distance.Quick, Miguel! Hit the mattress!You have strange customs up North.Here we go!Too late!Are we dead yet?Horse shit.What happened to the explosives?There ain't no explosives. My dumbass supplier must've given me organic fertiliser instead of chemical.--All I got here is four hundred pounds of lightly fried horse apples.-----Give me a minute to think, Duane.Okay.{Pffffffffffft! Frp (Unimpressive, flatulent noise)}Maybe I'm wrong but you seemed kind of evasive when I asked you what you had in the truck before.Damn right I was being evasive! I couldn't talk in front of the foreign national, see?-George, I'm on a top secret classified mission for Uncle Sam.--------Is Miguel the reason you're here?Pretty smart, George.I was supposed to make contact with him.By the time I found him, though, he was in jail. I've been trying to figure out a way to get him out since then.-------Sounds good to me. Count me in.Good man, George. All I need is a detonator...lText Resource 3377lText Resource 700����%Du��Hs�����=i���?p�;Ox����5b�����'Wr�����		?	[	�	�	�	



Mmmf!
Hold still. This might hurt a little...Ow!
Think yourself lucky you don't have a moustache.
And to find out more, I called Professor Oubier who invited me to his mansion.
At least... I thought it was Oubier...I got the impression that Pablo was nervous when he was around, too.I found these in your bag.Oh. They were a gift.I know. I read the note.God knows what was going through Andre's mind...I think that's quite plain enough!About time! You could at least have helped me before grabbing everything you could find!Not so loud. They'll hear you.Get these ropes off me, right now.The mood you're in, maybe that's not such a good idea.Thank god it's you, George. How did you find me?I'll explain later. We have to get out of here.Where's Pablo - the big guy?Out cold. Too much wine doesn't agree with him...George! Where are you going?I'll be back in a moment.What about me?Don't panic... Everything's under control.There. How are you feeling?George! What are you doing?Mmmmf!Will you look at this?Put it down and untie me!Do you know what it is?No, but it's been watching me for the last twenty-four hours!Pablo put it there - to scare me, I think.Mm - mmf! Mmmmmff!It was a small statue of a kneeling figure in an ornate head dress.The head was hideous, with huge staring eyes set in a decomposing face.George! Untie me - now!Mmmf!Did you notice that chart on the police station wall?Yes - it looked like a map to me, but I couldn't make out the details.Whatever it was, the General didn't want us to see it...Could you distract the General while I take a look at the chart?You're kidding! Did you see the way he was leering at me?Hey - it's market day!What was it you wanted to talk about?It's the Eagle Stone!I didn't think she'd be interested...Why did you show him the stone?I thought maybe he might know something about it...Well, he does now, for sure! He knows we have it!He was the Sergeant who disappeared while we were investigating the Templars!Oh, yeah. I forgot.Hey! Somebody's marketing Lobineau dolls!-Maybe the professor really is innocent...We can't use the elevator! If that thug Pablo has recovered, he'll be waiting for us!We've got to do something. Where does that door lead to?I'm not sure...What on earth are you doing?...but he sounded nothing like the man in the police station.There was nothing else I wanted to talk to Nico about at that time...But it's your harebrained scheme - you do the talking.What...Get me out of this chair!George! Wake up!Huh? Oh... sorry. I was distracted by that dumb TV show.I can see very well what distracted you! It's rubbish, George.'Passion Avenue...' My favourite programme. Groovy!Yeah. Hot stuff!Okay - tell me what you know about Kondor.Kondor Transglobal exports Aztec and Mayan relics from Central America to Europe.But that's just a cover for the real business... drug smuggling!What proof do you have?Nothing yet.Do you know where Kondor is based?In Central America. A place called Quaramonte.Quaramonte! That's what the little guy kept saying!I thought it was his name!No - that's Titipoco.Titty what?Titipoco. That's what Pablo called him.I saw that name on a docket downstairs.You came on a little strong with the General...!I was merely flattering his ego, George.Every man has his Achilles heel...Maybe, but that guy's weakness isn't in his foot!Tell me about this Karzac guy.Well, I saw him for only a few minutes, but he frightens me.There was no point in disturbing her while she was that sick...His eyes - they're like a wild animal's, like a tiger.That's what scared me most about him; he looked so unpredictable and dangerous.Nah. It's too much of a coincidence that he's here in Quaramonte.Did you know Oubier's wife was a film star?No. I didn't know he was married. What happened to her?She died. In mysterious circumstances, apparently.How mysterious?I heard she was murdered. Possibly by Oubier himself.A murderer, huh? Andr� said he was something of a celebrity...Lobineau tells me he's been seeing a lot of you...We meet sometimes for lunch, a drink - you know.After you'd gone back to the States I was pretty lonely, you know.Lonely? You must have been desperate! Couldn't you just... visit the zoo, or something?Did I hear you refer to Inspector Moue?Yes. You remember him?Of course I do! But I thought he was dead?Oh, no. He reappeared after the Broken Sword case had blown over.When he found out who was in with the Neo-Templars he went into hiding.Moue knew more than was good for him.Does he know about our involvement with the case?If he does he's not telling. Still, he got a sudden promotion...No, I don't. A lot has happened to me in the last year...Mmmmf!Don't panic. I'll be back in a moment. That man we saw talking to the General was Oubier! Didn't you recognise him?I've never met him, remember? The guy I called in Paris claimed to be Oubier...Nico...? I've brought you this root...C'mon - five minutes is all I need.I knew Oubier had been in Marseilles - but never mind about me...Are you okay?I don't see any cabs. Let's ask someone how we get to Quaramonte City.Okay. Keep your eyes peeled for any sign of Kondor Transglobal...Yeah. You'd make a great snake charmer...Of course I'm not okay! Untie me this instant!Did that Indian guy mistreat you?If you forget about the abduction, verbal threats and bondage, no.What about the little guy?I don't think he knows where he is or what he's doing here.The big guy, Pablo - he brought Titipoco from the jungle.Titty what?Titipoco. That's what I heard Pablo call the dwarf.Anyway, we've got to get out of here...Nico! Wait!Could you give me a hand to push this statue?What for?This, my dear, is our passport to freedom.If you say so... dear.Okay. Push!Great teamwork!Nice to be working with you again, Mister Stobbart.How about you tell me exactly what's going on, starting with that Mayan stone.I picked it up from one of Karzac's men in Paris. I was expecting a consignment of narcotics!Trying to raise the statue so I can hook it to that pulley.Yes. The proof I needed to expose Karzac's smuggling operation.Oh, thanks, George. How on earth did you find me?Drugs!?I'd set it up to act as his courier, and once I had the proof I planned to go straight to Inspector Moue.But instead of the dope I'd expected, they sent me that stone instead!I don't get it. If Karzac's business is drugs, why is he so desperate to get his hands on that stone?Nico?Hunh?Maybe it has some significance to the local people in Central America.Would you like a biscuit?'Gourmet Dog'! Have you been eating those things, George?Sure! They're great!It could be Karzac's means of getting them to work for him.Uhh...I don't think she even recognised me...Guess what this is. Go on - guess!It's wrought iron, probably from a chimney stack on an old stove.Uh... well - I suppose it could be.How did she know that?My grandfather used to work in a foundry.Is that really going to help us?I like to keep myself occupied in times of stress...-No way she was going to be able to chew the root..I needed to give her the antidote in a more digestible form...----Do you recognise this?Is that the dart which knocked me out?That's right. I kept it as a souvenir.Have you any idea who this little statue is supposed to be?I'm not very well acquainted with Mayan deities, George.But whatever his name, he sure is ugly.Take a look at this, Nico.That's disgusting, George! Why are you carrying it around with you?I don't know. I just can't seem to part with it...-----Look - the little guy downstairs was chained up with these!That must have been Pablo's doing.-I don't blame him, though. That little guy is dangerous.You're still sore about that poisoned dart?Of course I'm sore.Do you have that masking tape you were gagged with?Yeah - right here.What do want with that?It's the only thing I've ever known to keep you quiet...---Take a look at this...An eclipse of the sun. Why the sudden interest in astronomy?I found the cutting in Oubier's house.Apparently, it's only visible from Central America...-Do you know what I'd like to do with this rope?What? I hope this hasn't got anything to do with Andr�...No. I'd like to give that Pablo guy a taste of his own medicine.I wouldn't advise it, George. He's a nasty piece of work.Take a look at this...Mon Dieu! Where did you get that kind of money?It's not mine - I found that statement at Oubier's house.Do you have any theories about this stone?I think that design represents a dog. A Mexican dog...So this is the sacred Chihuahua stone? Sheesh...Here's the stone I found in the Caribbean...Well, maybe...What do you plan to do with the stones when all this is over?I figured I'd take them back to Paris and sell them.That guy at the gallery will probably give us a few thousand francs for them...I don't know.

Hi there. George Stobbart.
Uh-huh. Yeah. Haiku McEwan.You're playing Jim Hawkins, right?Jimbo. I had Mr Hawks change his name.Jimbo Hawkins. Right.--Hey - Haiku.Yeah, man.-Is your name really Haiku?Yeah. It was my mom's idea, okay?When I was born I was so small and perfectly formed I reminded her of a Japanese poem.I guess it could have been worse. She could have called you Limerick.That's my middle name.Did you always want to be an actor?I don't think of what I do as acting, man.You're not alone...It's more like I'm the voice of my generation...What I'm saying, I'm saying for the kids on the street.Which is what? 'I'm crap, I'm going nowhere...?'Huh? What are you saying, man?Stobbart! Get out of shot! Positions, everybody!Haiku, baby...are you ready?Okay, man. Uh... which scene is this?You've been captured by Silver's accomplice, Pirate Babs, who's fallen in love with you.-That whirring sound you can hear is Robert Louis Stevenson spinning in his grave.Okay, people. Top of page seventy-six, Sharon.What about my big speech?It's been cut.Everybody ready?Up to speed.Quiet on the set! Okay, let's make magic!Oh, please......and... Action!Why don't you forget that dumb ol' Squire and his bunch of merry men...Can't you see we were made for each other?I know, but Squire Trelawny saved my life, Cap'n Babs.Why, if it hadn'ta bin for him, that giant octopus woulda made mincemeat outa me!But right now he thinks you're a traitor.He's locked you out of the stockade, Jimbo!That twenty foot high wall with spikes mighta kept out Silver's men......but it ain't gonna stop me!Oh - Jimbo!Natch, I'm a pro.Did I ever, boss. We should've made this movie in 3D.---I'll get a flipchart and explain it to you later, Haiku.Would you like a bun?No way, man. I have to be careful what I eat.Yeah, never eat anything smarter than yourself.I may not be making millions of dollars......and I may not have thousands of nubile if uncritical young women lusting for my body......but I've got something that you haven't.This small piece of coal.Man, you're getting freaky on me.D' you want a pancake?Look at that thing, man! It's dripping with syrup!You'll have every bug in ten miles on your case if you get that stuff on you!I guess you're right.And... cut! !Good heavy breathing, Sharon.Did you get the heavy breathing, Flash?-I'd like your opinion on something.Yeah? What?He was too interested in himself.Haiku, you were great! We're setting up for the stunt now so get a bite to eat.Savage! On set, dammit!You got somethin' to show me?There was nothing else I wanted to ask him.lText Resource 651�By��H��0O~�� c��#H��]��1Jo��	g	�	



Cut!
Uh... I can explain everything.
Don't bother!I'm sorry. I didn't realise you were making a movie.
So who are you?Hey! Get out of there!
Hey!Get out of shot!Stobbart. George Stobbart.Two B's and two T's.It's okay, Mr Hawks. He wasn't in shot.Stay out of the way, surfer boy. I'll deal with you later...Surfer boy?Get that camera rolling! This could be good!Cut and print it! That was brilliant, folks!Okay - the next scene is down on the beach.This is where Hawkins finds the treasure in the cave of the crabs...Would those be giant killer crabs, by any chance?Giant mutant killer crabs, with attitude.I was talking to Mr Savage, the stuntman... Is he all right?What makes you say that?He's not making any sense.The guy's English.What's the name of the movie?Are you trying to be funny?No.It's Treasure Island! The only book I ever read twice!I don't recall any girls in Treasure Island...Nah. I had to write 'em in. This ain't no faggot movie!So you've filled the Hispaniola with babes...Gotta think box office! People like that kind of thing.What other changes have you made to the story?Just a few minor details.You haven't written out Long John Silver?Are you questioning my integrity as an artist?Of course Silver's still in it. We've even hung onto Captain Flint.His parrot.His trained attack falcon. Why do you think Blind Pew's blind?Nuffing on this earth would get me to climb up there.Did you say you've changed the ending of the story?That's right.Do they find the treasure?Yeah - but that comes later, after they've escaped the volcanic eruption.A volcano?Sure. Krakatoa.Who's playing Jim Hawkins?Haiku McEwan. Don't tell me you never heard of him?I don't go to the movies too often.Jeez! Haiku is only the hottest teen star in Hollywood!That's why we're on such a tight schedule...Gotta film the close ups before he hits puberty.Who's the leading lady?Don't you recognize her? That's Sharon Kowalski!Oh, right!I'd never heard of her.That's a career limiting remark, Savage.My career's over, mate. Me back's buggered.I've been thinking it over... I'll be your stuntman.You know what the locals call this place, don't you?No, but I guess you're going to tell me.Zombie Island...Zombies..?A crazed gleam came into his eye.Get me the writers! Get me make-up! I want zombie pirates in this movie by the end of today!You don't look happy.Why should I be happy? Look at that cave. It's supposed to be where the treasure is.So?Look at it! It's crap! Does that look like the sort of place anybody would hide treasure?I should've had props build me a proper damn cave. A cinematic cave!What do you mean, a 'cinematic' cave?One with drama! Danger!One that looks like the mouth of a big, stone skull would be cool but I'd settle for drama and danger.Hey you! Trouble!Who? Me?There it was - the rock I'd seen from the Camel's Hump...Now that I was close up I could make out a small cave near the top of the pillar.I want you to stay right where I can keep an eye on you.I'm not one of your lackies, Hawks! I go where I like.Not here you don't. The movie company has rented this island for the duration.You're trespassing. Do as you're told or you're gone.Who the hell are you?Aieeeeeeeeeeee!Why don't you use that cave up on the rock pillar at the end of the beach?We don't have a stuntman anymore.You?Hey, I'll do the stunt!Yeah, sure, if it means I get to dress up as a pirate...I appreciate the offer but if you fall, you'll sue us.No, I won't.Everybody hear that?Good enough, we're covered. Got any experience?Death defying leaps, desperate fist fights, getting caught in explosions, you name it.That's a dramatic cave if ever I saw one.--Okay, people! Move out! We're shooting the scene at the end of the beach!Shoot, I forgot about that. No go, Stobbart. We'll have to use this cave after all.-I've been talking to the cameraman...-He's got a portable camera.So?So you can use the cave in that rock pillar at the end of the beach...We ain't got a stabilized harness for it. The camera'll wobble.Did D.W. Griffiths have a stabilized harness when he made 'Birth of a Nation'?You're right, dammit! Hitchcock! Welles! None of them needed one!For crying out loud, Sam Raimi stabilized his camera on a plank!Props! Get me a plank! We're gonna wing it!Hot dog! We're gonna do a cinema verit� pirate movie!On my way!Ready when you are, Mr Hawks!Hawks? This had to be Carlton Hawks, the newest enfant terrible of Tinseltown.I'd read about him, 'Mail room boy makes good'.Nice to know it was still possible to get to be a director armed only with an encyclopaedic knowledge of postal charges.Hey! Surfer boy! Stay out of there!Oh, what is it this time?That's the wardrobe tent. You've no business to be going in there.Looked like I wasn't going to get to play 'dress up'.All the millions spent on a movie and nobody thinks to buy an atlas.Mr Hawks, I was wondering if...Not now, I've got a movie to make.Do what?Plank, spikes, wall, over. Easy, a child could do it.At my age? You must be jokin'!I could replace you, Savage.Replace me? Lumme. This could be the last stunt I ever perform.I need to think about this. Get myself in the right frame of mind...A suicidal one would fit the bill for that stunt.Fine, you do that. In the meantime we'll break for lunch.Oh, great! I'm famished!Stay right there and meditate, Savage.Tight-arsed little git.Time for the stunt, Savage!It's a short run, bounce on the plank and somersault over the spikes and stockade wall.Yeah. With an arthritic baboon.I heard it.No, we're not. The camera's still bogged down.George! Get to wardrobe! We're gonna make you a star!lText Resource 1357;�#Ux���5m~���m���9����2v��2W��

Hi. George Stobbart.'Allo, mate.You're English, right?
Blimey, you don't miss much, do you? Bert Savage.Hi, Bert.Don't you hi me! Fine friend you turned out to be!What's the problem?Huh!'Ave you seen wot the caterer's laid on today?Buns and pancakes.Yeah... Nice 'ere, innit? My Beryl used t' luv the seaside.Day aht at Clacton - bloody smashin'.A pinta jellied eels washed dahn wiv a bottla brahn...Quick feel on the big wheel an' a stroll arahnd the tahn.Course, them days you could live like a flippin' king on ten bob a night!Tombola, frothy coffee at the caff on the prom...You know, I don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.The pancake oozed maple syrup all over Bert's chins.Another pancake, Bert?What's it like to work with Carlton Hawk?Flippin' misery, mate.How long have you been in the movie business?Flippin' years, mate. Absolutely flippin' years! I was in the army before that.Thought to meself - you bin riskin' yer bleedin' neck every day, why not cash in on it, like?So you became a stunt man, just like that?Nah! 'Course not! I had to do the training first.What training does a stunt man do?First, they told me to stand in the road, then they run me down!Straight up! Drove at me with a car. I couldn't believe it!I was up on the bonnet and over the other side before I realised he wasn't stopping.Then they threw me dahn stairs a bit and gives me a certificate.That's awful.It's an improvement on yesterday. The buns are stale, but the pancakes are bloody lovely!How long have you been in the movies?Ooh, years. I started in the British film industry - when there was such a fing...I saw it all go down the khazi.Course, it was those 'kitchen sink dramas' wotdunnit.One minute it was 'istorical romances and me getting shoved through windas by James Mason......next thing, it's all Rita Tushingham and getting flattened by Blackpool trams.Call that drama? 'Cos I don't!I don't want to worry you, but there's a hornet's nest over in that bush.Hornets? That reminds me of a film I was in - The Black Hornet.The Black Hornet? I don't remember seeing that one.Before your time, most likely.What happens in it?Lumme, what don't 'appen in it? I was shot, stabbed, fed to piranhas......dangled from an airship and trampled by a zebra.No, I mean what was the plot?Plot?Who's the big star?Which one? They all think they're stars...The young guy - Jim Hawkins.Oh, him. Snotty brat. Straight off the streets, can't act.That's Haiku McEwan. You're lookin' at a box office of twenty million, guaranteed.He must have something special...It ain't talent.What films have you worked on in the past?Remember 'Death Stalker of the Tenth Grade'?The psychotic biker what crashed into the school bus? That was me.Or what about 'They Prayed to Satan'? I was the bloke in the hospital scene...You know, the one who caught fire? Fell through the flippin' skylight?I don't think I caught those...Did you ever work with Carol Kleimachs?The Dirty Dachshund? I'll say. Flippin' princess, mate.I heard she was very beautiful.Mind you, she acted like one, too! Ordering this, demanding that...Did you ever meet Bertrand Oubier?Meet him, no. I saw him a few times, though.'E didn't like 'is wife bein' in films.Do you think Oubier murdered his wife?I wouldn't be surprised if 'e did!Mind you, there were plenty of people who could 'ave done 'er in!I thought the public loved her...?Yeah, but people who knew 'er saw the other side...Have you ever seen anything like this before?What's that, mate? Stone Axe?No, it's just a piece of polished stone.Very nice. Very nice indeed! Shine it up a bit, you'd get a few bob for that.Yeah - go on.What do you think of this lipstick?Oh, very nice. Very 'Rapouche'.I thought that meant 'hideous'?I was bein' sarky. Looks like a skin disease, that stuff.No thanks, mate. I've plenty here.Do you want to try some syrup with your pancakes?Look, Bert, what's wrong?You've got a bloody nerve.If I didn't know better, I'd've thought you gave me that pancake just so's them hornets would go for meOh, Bert. You've wounded me! How can you think that?Well, by looking at the evidence.I don't know why you want to still be a stuntman anyway. I've had a great idea! How about you dress up as Jim Hawkins and climb up to that cave over there?What cave? THAT cave? You must fink I'm barmy!I did me back in bein' chased by them 'ornets over that flamin' stockade wall!No way am I goin' up there!Well, that narrowed the field.'Cos it's all I know, innit? If I don't do this, what do I do?How about being a stunt co-ordinator?Bein' a what?You stand around in a big jacket and a baseball cap, telling the stuntpeople what to do.I can do that?Hey, you've done the job for years and you're not dead.That's got to be good for morale.Well, I dunno...You get your own megaphone...I'll do it!George Stobbart, international adventurer and roaming career advisor.It must be cool getting to travel the world like this?What 'ave you got there?I didn't think he'd be interested in that...I had nothing else to ask him just then.Would you like a pancake, Bert?Don't mind if I do.No thanks, mate. I've got to watch my waistline.Oi! You put bloody syrup on that pancake......and now it's messed me all up!Would you like this pot of syrup?No way. I'm messed up enough already!No thanks, mate. I don't like the stuff.Would you like a bun?No way! The last one I tried cracked my dentures.I'm not having another one of them!lText Resource 1358lText Resource 2468:��:x�����	

Hey, there. I'm George Stobbart.
Well, hi, handsome! You're cute.I couldn't think of anything else to talk to her about.I wish it was you playing the lead male, instead of that kid.I can't act, ma'am.So what? I bet you can kiss...-I couldn't believe I was having this conversation with a real movie star!Hi!Hi, gorgeous!-----------What's it like sharing the spotlight with an actor who's young enough to be your son?Whaddya mean?What do you think of Hawks' treatment of Treasure Island?It's okay, I guess. I never saw the original.It's a book. One of my favourites.Really? The novelisation's out already?What part are you playing?Pirate Babs - the ruthless and passionate lady buccaneer.It's a great part. I get to kiss a lot, and I kick ass. Like the boots?Dog biscuit?Uh... no. No, thank you.Would you like this lipstick?Nice thought, gorgeous, but I prefer scarlet.Would you like this bun?All right! Oh - wait a minute. Hawks is watching me.Don't let him see it. Ooh! He's looking right at me!What's the matter?Never mind. Just put that cake away and pretend you weren't talking to me.What do you think of these?Ew! They're awful!You have no idea how much you've just gone up in my estimation.Take a look at this ancient Mayan artefact...That's just a hunk of stone with a picture scratched on it.In a way, I guess. You don't happen to have seen anything similar, have you?No.---Would you like a bite of this pancake?Hell, no. I only have to look at those things and my thighs swell like balloons.An interesting concept.I found this reed in the swamp on the other side of the island...Oh, yeah?Yeah - and I used it to shoot a poisoned dart at a wild boar!It was real life drama, not just a scene from a movie.Right.She was having trouble with the whole 'Real life is not a movie' concept.lText Resource 1359lText Resource 3454KvwWe arrived to find George being led up the stairs.We clearly didn't have much time...lText Resource 2680"x�Gs���-i���Au��Cv��"Bv��%m���axyz���


It looked like Karzac was using Quaramontean troops and local Indians as his guards.No way did I want to get into conversation with that pack of vermin.The steps were guarded by a bunch of Karzac's thugs.Those jackals weren't going to let me past.It looked like a fuel line.The fuel from the severed line had formed a pool.It was the pool of spilt fuel from the generator.The engine looked like it was supposed to power the lift.It was the cylinder from the generator, now full of petrol.It was a length of strong rope.The rope hung down from the top of the gantry.It was a small but very enticing button.The motor spluttered into life.The engine stopped dead.The button didn't seem to do anything.There was a lever mounted on the side of the motor.I couldn't reach the lift platform from the ground.It was a simple wooden platform lift, used for shifting equipment, I presumed.The engine was working okay but it wasn't connected to the equipment lift.There was an unlit torch by the base of the steps.I didn't want to push my luck by talking with the guards again.I really didn't want to talk to them.No way was I going to touch the fire! Self-immolation isn't my style.The fuel was burning violently.The cap was attached to the lift engine by a chain.It was an old electricity generator.I could think of no reason why I would want to pull a heavy torch from the ground.There was too much fuel squirting about for my liking.I wasn't going to risk amputation by meddling with a spinning flywheel!The scaffold gantry went all the way up the pyramid.The lift was no use if I wasn't on it.It was Titipoco, my new found ally.It was a small, screw-fit cylindrical housing.Okay, copy!lText Resource 2309

The snake bite had affected Nico badly.-I needed to extract the antidote from the root...-Outside the doorway, the ladder led back down to Terra Firma.That organ represented years of painstaking work.It was Father Hubert's magnificent organ.I wasn't in the mood for playing the organ.It was a water jug.I couldn't steal from a priest.It was Father Hubert's personal altar.I thought it best not to defile the altar while Hubert was looking after Nico...I wondered what Hubert had used to make his candles...I didn't have any use for Hubert's candles.Father Hubert: a man with a mission.lText Resource 589-�����4DFHJLNPRTVXZ\^`bd��Hj��Ao��I|~���Bv��#1�������������������					Hey, Twenty!Here, boy!Here, boy!

Maybe it was part of a structure which no longer existed.My arms weren't long enough to reach the platform.--I felt a slight twinge of conscience as I prepared to give the dog a dunking.It soon passed.As I'd expected, the dog could swim like a... well, like a dog.The steps led back to the dockside.The trapdoor barred my way into the watchman's hut.The floorboards above me creaked ominously under the watchman's weight.The opening in the floor led up into the watchman's hut.The watchman must have bolted the trapdoor.The guard dog was staring at me with a hungry look in his eyes. lText Resource 2646?�@c���Ue��Pu�;j��#��.Jv���4l���N��	V	{	�	�	

A wooden box was connected to the nearby water wheel.
The machine seemed to be pumping air up to the tree house.It seemed to be working just fine.It was a pile of damp leaves.It was a pile of damp leaves.The leaves were too damp to burn on their own.The bank statement was just what I needed to kindle the damp leaves...Two round stones were carefully balanced on a wooden structure.It was a press.I left the village at dawn, and stumbled back through the jungle in a post-party daze.The stones were too heavy to turn by hand.The leverage from the cross allowed me to turn one of the stones, but the other one remained stationary.Now I had the contraption working...The vine provided a drive belt to connect the two stones.So there I was, hundreds of miles from civilisation, doing the housework for a priest.The juice from the root was soaking into the ground!The cone was ideal as a makeshift container...The water wheel had been built to provide a natural source of power.It was a water wheel.The iron rim of the water wheel would have torn the skin from my fingers if I'd touched it...As I held the fetish to the iron rim of the wheel a shower of sparks cascaded onto the leaves.I couldn't see any great benefit in sharpening the cross.Father Hubert wouldn't have appreciated it if I'd ruined his collar.There was no need to press the collar again.It was a large wooden crossIt was heavy. I guess that was intentional.The contraption consisted of a crude wooden wheel with wooden slats.It was a roughly built washing machine.The machine was broken.There was no point in putting the collar in the machine.That wasn't going to help me prepare a cure for Nico...Interwoven vines made up what looked like a drive belt.It was a rope of vines.That vine rope could be useful...I'd always wanted a tree house like that when I was a kid...There was no way of climbing up to the tree house.NOT USED (See ds) Should I shout to it now or do you want me to interact with it?It would look like a church if I could fasten this cross to it.It was the owner of the tree house, and he wasn't happy.The sound of running water always made me need the toilet...Perfect for a game of Pooh sticks...The leaves were burning and creating a lot of smoke...The leaves were burning just fine.As the liquid was squeezed from the root it collected in the cone.The ashes were all that remained of the leaves.It's a strange world...It was Father Hubert.Hello! Anyone home?The press worked surprisingly well on the collar.The ladder led up to Father Hubert's tree house.I placed the newspaper clipping over the damp leaves.The leaves were burnt to ashes.It was just like sneaking back to my parents' house when I was younger...The cone contained the precious antidote.The cone was empty.But I followed the sound and discovered a tree house in a nearby clearing.I placed the bank statement over the damp leaves.The wheel had a rim of roughly beaten iron.Except Oakland didn't have monkeys or parrots.The newspaper clipping was just what I needed to kindle the damp leaves...I promised myself that I would never reveal what went on that night.I briefly considered diving into the crystal waters.

That's HOT!Now I could see into the pipe which formed the chimney.That chimney looked very exposed without its cone.Hmm...The bottle had blocked the chimney......and the hut was filling up with smoke.It was a tall wire mesh fence.I couldn't climb the fence while the watchman was looking.Breaking steel padlocks with my bare hands was a feat I'd never mastered...The gates were fastened with a heavy duty padlock.It was the curious platform which stuck out over the water.The fence and the dog prevented me from getting to the platform.The bottle was half filled with water.

One piece of dirty coal is quite enough.
I realised that that wasn't such a good idea.It was a small window through which the guy could watch over the entrance to the docks.It was the night watchman.Oh, no - I'd learned my lesson.------------------------------------It was a packet with a picture of a Boxer dog on the front...I couldn't reach the packet...The packet was full of dog biscuits...It was a box of blank forms.I couldn't reach that far...The box contained nothing but blank forms.A shabby old overcoat hung from a peg near the door.It was the watchman's overcoat.I couldn't reach the coat...I wouldn't have considered wearing it if it had been the last coat on Earth.It was a large bucket filled with coal.I couldn't reach the bucket...Someone had once told me a piece of coal brought you luck...Who was I to argue with irrational superstition?It was a filthy, stained coffee mug.I couldn't reach the cup...That mug was a health risk. I decided to leave it where it was.It was the door which led to the docks on the other side of the fence...I couldn't reach the door without climbing into the room...It was the trapdoor which the slob used as a waste chute - straight into the sea!It was the trapdoor leading to the jetty under the hut.It was a trapdoor set in the floor of the hut...I couldn't reach it from outside the hut!It was an old blackened kettle.I couldn't reach the kettle.I couldn't think of one good reason to steal the watchman's kettle.It was the only source of light in the watchman's hut...No way could I reach the light from where I was standing...The watchman was big and bulgy like a sack of potatoes.His flushed and bloated face wore a sleepy, amiable expression.-Something was bubbling in the watchman's saucepan...The saucepan was three quarters full of baked beans.-Baked beans in ketchup...The spike held a stack of papers which appeared to be shipping documents.None of them referred to Kondor Transglobal.It was a stack of printed documents.Impaled on a spike were a number of documents...The watchman wasn't going to let me near the papers.I couldn't reach the documents.I didn't have any use for those documents.It was an old iron stove which heated the hut and the watchman's dinner.Yow!Stove equals heat; heat equals burn; burn equals excruciating pain...lText Resource 2543%�����:@egi��-P��AX���

Sorry, father - but I needed to attract your attention.Quick, man - put out that fire! I've got a sick woman up here!Me? Oh, but... I can't!There was nothing else I wanted to ask him.Can't? Nico's life depends on it!You're right. Of course I should, despite my own guilt and shame...Please, don't disturb the girl.Who are you, and what do you want?My name is Stobbart. George Stobbart.I'm Father Hubert. I don't suppose you speak French?Hunh? Why do you want to know that?I found a young woman with a fever by the river this morning.I don't understand her, but I think she's speaking French.Hang on - that must be Nico!But... I can't go as a representative of God with a creased collar!Give me your collar. I'm sure I can find a way to press it!What are you doing out here in the jungle?God's work. Not quite the destination I had in mind when I set out, but...Well, you know what they say - mysterious ways, and so on.You didn't plan to end up here?No - I was on my way to the miner's camp in the north.Where can I find this root?I don't know, but maybe the shaman at the village can tell us.Will you show me the way to the villageThe poor girl is close to death, and there's nothing I can do for her but pray.I was stuck here when my boat capsized on the river.That's exactly what happened to me! How long have you been here?Eleven years.That's my girlfriend you've got in your treehouse!I ran out of penicillin and morphine years ago.What's the matter with her?She's been bitten by a venomous river snake.But - can't you do something for her? There's a cure, isn't there?But the local people speak of a root which they believe will counteract the poison.Yes. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I found myself doing... the Monkey Dance!I've never heard it called that before......and I didn't want to pry any deeper into Hubert's murky past.The shaman thinks you should go visit your kids...So... he told you.Thank you my son. In the meantime, I must contemplate my sermon.Here's your collar, Father.Thank you, George.You probably think it a little odd of me to make such a fuss...Oh, no! If I'd been living in the jungle for eleven years, I'd be completely screwy too!Screwy? Yes, perhaps I am... ever since my last visit to that village.Do you want to tell me what happened at the village?I forgot my vows. I let myself be overwhelmed by the beauty of this unspoiled paradise.And, in a moment of weakness, animal passion reared its rampant head!There was obviously more than a creased collar bothering the priest...You know, you should be writing romantic novels...Did you experience some kind of, uh... physical liaison at the village?Now you've got your collar back will you take me to the village?I've still not finished my sermon...Look, father, I still don't know why you're so reluctant to visit that village, and it's none of my business.Whatever the reason, it can't be more important than saving Nico's life!You're right. I must be crazy.We must make haste if we're to reach the village before nightfall.Look, Hubert - having a... well, an extended family is nothing to be ashamed of.If I was you I'd be ashamed of not being there for them.It was that damned Monkey Dance that led me astray!Yeah. A sight like that must be difficult to forget...I've got the root, Hubert!So what are you waiting for? Give it to the girl!Right.I've tried, but she won't take it.You fool, George. You'll have to extract the sap so that she can drink it.Look, Hubert - the antidote!Well, what are you waiting for? Give it to the girl, quickly!Nico!Here, drink this.Oh, George - it's horrible!Just swallow it down...Try to rest now, darling.You'll need all your strength when we go after the other two stones...Other stones?What other stones? What have you gotten me into now, George Stobbart?The patient is sounding more like her old self already...Where do you think you're going?I've got to see Nico.Please, my son - I know it's hard for you but she really mustn't be disturbed.A creased collar?The girl needs rest.You mean you put your personal attire higher than the life of a sick woman!I will not go to that village looking anything but my best!

The creeper didn't look like it would hold my weight.It was a needle of rock in the middle of the clearing.It didn't look like a natural formation.I remembered Ketch's log - 'For is it not writ that 'tis easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle...?It seemed pretty relevant now.No good. I'd have to be bitten by a radioactive spider before I stood any chance of getting up there.The rock was partially overgrown by creepers.The creeper just came away from the rock as I pulled it.The creeper lay on the ground, looking pretty crept out.The marker wasn't going to stay attached to anything as thick as the creeper.Great. I'd created some sort of creeper - marker - fishing net assembly.The net attached easily enough to the creeper and seemed secure.Sometimes I terrify myself with my creative genius.I'd successfully got the marker into a position near the top of the needle......simply by using the kind of lateral thinking that can get you institutionalised.There was no point in untying the net from the creeper.There was no telling where it went.It would be easier if I pulled away some of the creeper first.The creeper felt unpleasant and fleshy.I could see no point in tying the net to the creepers on the rock.There was no point in tying the net and marker to the creepers near the bottom of the rock.It was the crept-out creeper with the net tied to it.The marker was fastened to the creeper by the net.Now it was starting to look like something useful.The marker was attached to the net which was, in turn, attached to the creeper.It was the net, now attached to the creeper.That high up, the marker should be visible for miles.I wasn't going to pull it down now I'd got it up there.lText Resource 1020?�@���Ouwy�������������������������$J����+Sj��)=���

I wouldn't have been heard over the din of the fan.
I decided there was a better way to attract their attention.
The fan was a real mess - a splintered boat hook, dented blades, and a shorted motor.The boat hook was jammed in the dented fan blades.The room was filled with Transglobal crates.All the crates were firmly sealed.It was an old, creaky, heavy, splintery, wooden door.I wasn't going back out there. Oh no.--Lucky for me that window was unlocked...-----------------------There was a small drawer in the desk.Knowing my luck, it was bound to be locked...There was nothing else in the drawer.The only interesting thing I found was a small brass key.I'd already searched the drawer.It was an elevator to the upper floor.I couldn't pry the doors apart with my bare hands.There was usually an easier way to do it...It was the button to call the elevator.It was a powerful fan.I couldn't reach the blades of the fan, which was just as well.If I'd stuck my fingers in there, I'd never be able to play guitar again.I thought better of tampering with a high speed fan.That did the trick.The fan clunked and shorted out as its blades were mashed by the boat hook.A filing cabinet!I'd need a crowbar or a stick of dynamite to open that cabinet.But I wasn't here to check out the filing system.It was locked.The little brass key didn't fit the lock.There was a notice board beside the desk with an assortment of paperwork on it.It was a notice board.Among the paperwork which adorned the notice board was something which caught my eye...It was a delivery note from Kondor Transglobal, and the address was Quaramonte City.It's a place, not the little guy's name!I should have guessed he wouldn't have a stupid name like Quaramonte... There was nothing else of any interest on the notice board.It was the creep who'd kidnapped Nico, and I had a score to settle...The guy was partly hidden behind a stack of crates...lText Resource 15945���9Q���.]���0\���$h��"M���#^���.p���:X��	Z	q	�	�	R

It was Bert, the ageing stuntman.It was a plate of buns.The bun was so stale it felt like a small rock.I was already carrying one of the stale buns.I really didn't need another stale bun.I'd seen a lot of strange things on this island, but here was a bush that was buzzing!Now I knew why that bush was buzzing. Hornets!Ready when you are, Mister de Mille...It was the camera man.The kid looked more like a common street punk than a movie star.For some reason, the make up department had given him a liberal sprinkling of zits.It was the kid who was playing Jim Hawkins.It was teen idol Haiku McEwan, in his first starring role.The great director. That's what his pose was supposed to say.He reminded me of Ed Wood...It was a plank balanced precariously on a barrel.I wasn't going to upset Hawks any more by tampering with his props.It was the famous movie star - Sharon somebody or other...She couldn't act and she had a voice that could crack glass......but it wasn't hard to see why Hawks wanted her in his movie.More Davy Crockett than Long John Silver. It was a pile of pancakes which were being devoured by the big guy.It was a pile of pancakes which were being devoured by Bert.He couldn't get enough of them.Maple syrup had dribbled down Bert's face and shirt.It was a woman with huge boots and an impressive cleavage.I didn't want another one of the pancakes in my pocket.There was a pot of delicious looking maple syrup on the table.I wasn't going near that bush!As I walked towards the bush, it started buzzing angrily.I didn't think Hawks would want me roaming about in the stockade.I bet the camera never went round that side - but I could.{Loud buzzing}The pancake oozed maple syrup all over Bert's chins.It was a camera, mounted on a precarious dolly or whatever they call them.You wouldn't get me up there.It looked even worse than the one I'd just been through. I'd need a damn good reason before I'd go into those woods.The stockade was surrounded by a dry moat, filled with sharp wooden stakes.No way was I going to try to jump it. Those stakes looked real!The drawbridge was up.I couldn't see any way of lowering the drawbridge or any reason for wanting to.It was the forest I had just come through.I could think of about thirty thousand reasons for not going back in there and all of them had wings.Those hornets were not pleased...That was a lot of angry hornets!...but I was sure that they'd soon calm down.There was a hornets nest somewhere in that bush.It was a pile of pancakes much depleted by Bert.It was a pile of pancakes much depleted by the stuntman.lText Resource 1142�.t���4^��%BOp��,bz���X����/1���������������������������������������������������������������9��	�	�	L

The attendant didn't show it, but I sensed he was watching my every move.
The attendant was deep in thought, waiting for someone to answer his 'phone call.
According to the caption, this was the 'scrying mirror' given to Dr John Dee by Sir Francis Drake.I wasn't leaving here until I'd got what I'd come for.It was an obsidian stone with a carving of a jaguar.There was a small key in the lock...All that was left inside the cabinet was a card describing the missing stone.I took the key from the lock.There was no point in locking the cabinet now the stone was gone.The cabinet contained a dagger decorated with Mayan designs.The cabinet looked bare without the dagger.The cabinet was locked.There was nothing left in the cabinet.I wasn't going to leave until I knew where Oubier had gone.It was a small, flat square of polished obsidian - nothing like the one I was looking for.It was the obsidian mirror which Drake had given to John Dee.The cabinet was locked.The key didn't fit this lock.I'd already tried to open the cabinet with no success.The door didn't seem to have been used for a long time.Although there was no lock on the door, the rusty handle was jammed.I levered the handle open with the thin dagger.Beyond the door was a flight of steps leading down into darkness...The doors looked as though they might have been used not too long ago.The corridor led back to the main entrance.The two Japanese girls were inexplicably amused by something...I couldn't understand what the girls were laughing at.It was a woven wall hanging with a South American design.Behind the wall hanging was an old door.The cabinet was locked.It was a dagger, a Meso-American artefact.It was a small key, intended for a small lock. It was a stone identical in size and style to the coyote stone!It would probably be less suspicious if I kept away from the empty case.The key was evidence.It could stay that way, too.However, this stone bore the image of a jaguar.It was a 'phone, probably for staff only.I didn't need to make a call.The carving looked Central or South American in style, perhaps Aztec.I doubted I could sneak this enormous stone out under my jacket.The carving looked Buddhist in subject but Meso-American in execution.I wanted nothing to do with that statue. It made me nervous somehow.The display case contained a couple of vases.Perhaps I'm a Philistine but old vases bore me.The pots in the case seemed to amuse the girls no end.I had and have no interest in old pots.There was a huge carving of somebody who must have been important, once.There was nothing I wanted to do with the statue except find out where he bought his hat. Tr�s chic.The key unlocked the case.I locked the case again and took the key.The mask looked more African than American.I didn't want the mask although it certainly reminded me of somebody.The doors were securely locked.The dagger might lever open the doors, but I wasn't going anywhere until I knew where Oubier had gone.lText Resource 1601Qt��=V�`���-V���*V��������������������Poor old Bert looked in a bad way.It wasn't a surprise, considering what I'd put him through at the stockade.The truck carrying the camera had sunk into the wet sand.That camera wasn't going anywhere.It was a portable movie camera.The cave mouth was huge.It looked like an obvious place to hide treasure ... and that was probably why it wasn't the one Ketch had chosen.No point in going there - it wasn't the cave I'd seen from the Camel's Hump.Near the top of the towering rock was what appeared to be a cave mouth...Hawks wouldn't let me leave the set.

�Hola, se�ora.Hi! We were wondering...I was talking to the lady, chico.Hi. My name is Nicole Collard.Conchita Garcia. How can I help you, sister?The corporation I represent is considering a major investment in Quaramonte.Your advice, as the head of an obviously successful concern, is precisely what I'm after.My assistant, Mr Stobbart, has a few questions he'd like to ask you...No. Who is he?I got a good look at that chart in the police station. It's a map of Quaramonte.Do you know who owned Kondor Transglobal?I've no idea.Somebody wanted my mine closed down - for good.Do you have any kind of detonating device in stock?Have you heard of a man named Karzac?Would you be interested in these panties?They look about your size...Does it tell us where Oubier is heading?Yeah. A place called Teoculcan.I'd like to talk to that musician Miguel. Take the detonator and get him out of that jail!Where is the detonator?Keep out of there!Is that your best line, chico?Now the entire operation has been closed down.That's the site of the mine! I wonder why they're being so secretive about Oubier's plans...?I'm serious. They were an unwanted gift!That's where the explosives are stored.Put them away before you get over excited...There'd been trouble at that mine for several months; the workforce was getting smaller every day.Someone had started a rumour among the men that the mine was cursed.Where is the site of the mine?Can you tell me about the accident at the mine?Did the company operate here in Quaramonte?In the cupboard behind me.Do you have any evidence that the mine was sabotaged?Not yet, but I'll get to the bottom of it.Several days up river at a remote area known as Teoculcan.One thing's for sure - if the General's involved they're up to no good!Do you know Professor Oubier?Yes. I understand he is about to embark on an archaeological expedition.Accident? It was sabotage!Sure.Do you recognize the icon on this label?Kondor Transglobal.I can't simply give you a device like that - not without a damned good reason!Yes - they ran an old container ship. The Mayan Princess.Have you heard about the forthcoming eclipse?I don't take much interest in things like that. One of the boys might know about it.The General has a chart in his office which he was discussing with Oubier.Perhaps that chart will tell us where they're heading...Maybe, but I can't get anywhere near it while the General and his sidekick are there!Now why would the General be interested in an archaeologist...?Would you like a dog biscuit?They're kept in that cupboard.He hired some equipment from me earlier today...You see this? It's my lucky piece of coal.Nice buns...He's the reason we came to Quaramonte. We think he's running a drug ring.I overheard him talking to the General. I think they're working together.What?! If I'd known that I wouldn't have hired out the equipment!Would you like a smack in the mouth, chico?Does this stone mean anything to you?I think it is a spirit stone, carved by a Mayan priest, no?I don't know which of their many gods it represents.Can you tell me anything about this statue?It is Tezcatlipoca, the god of death and pestilence.What did you want to show me?She wouldn't have been interested.That fetish would be considered by many to be a bad omen.Well, I hope you find him, but I've never heard the name before.What's so lucky about it?I'm not sure yet...I had nothing else to talk about.Hey!Stay out of that cupboard!I don't suppose you have one spare...lText Resource 2993QY���:^� ��Ku� Q��+|�9lvwx���������<FGHI>?George!I realised those bastards were going to sacrifice George to Tezcatlipoca!Over my dead body.There was a pair of pots from which columns of smoke arose.It smelled coppery, like blood.

I didn't fancy Raoul's chances once Karzac didn't need him anymore.I might have been able to talk the General around if Pablo hadn't been there.It was Pablo, Karzac's right hand sadist.If Pablo had seen me, he'd have killed me.

Hi! My name's George Stobbart.
Welcome, George.
To England...
Why is Father Hubert so reluctant to visit the village?
Tchah! Is nothing sacred with these people?But how did they trap Tez... the evil god?My girl friend's been bitten by a snake.And you want me to heal her?That's the idea. Can you do it?I'm not sure. My gums aren't what they used to be...Listen - my girl is in a coma. Please, old man - give me the root.What root?Can you show me the way to the pyramid of Tezcatlipoca?Not until you possess all three stones.They built a pyramid which they told Tezcatlipoca was dedicated to him.Father Hubert told me of a root which could cure the bite of the river snake...At its centre, they fashioned a huge mirror of perfectly smooth obsidian.If that root is my chance of saving Nico's life, then I want it. Fast.There is time yet, George Stobbart. Time to learn why you were called here.Luring him into the pyramid with praise and flattery, they used sorcery to ensnare him in the mirror.---Fine. If I listen to your story, then will you give me the root?The eel travels far, but still returns to the place of his spawning...And look, I'm running a tight schedule so can you skip the riddles?It has long been foretold that a white man would bring the coyote stone to this village.Now do I get the root?Here - take it.Make haste if you wish to save the girl's life.The hummingbird sings to me of death to come...Now you're talking in riddles again.Listen, is it okay if I crash here? I've got no chance of finding my way through the jungle in the dark.That was our secret, known only to members of my tribe!-Ketch retired from piracy and bought an island in the Caribbean.You'd think he'd want to spend some time with his kids!Did you say Father Hubert has kids?What do I do when I find the stones?There's an eclipse of the sun due very soon, isn't there?Correct. The eclipse which marks the ending of the Fifth Age will come before the next full moon.Three girls and five boys, by my reckoning.Bring them here to me, and I shall prepare you.I don't know. He used to come here a lot, but then he just stopped...What happened to the stones?The stones must be taken to the heart of the pyramid.Only there can they be used to seal the gate by which Tezcatlipoca will return to this world.The Jaguar stone was captured by an English captain, El Draco.The Eagle stone was taken by a pirate called Ketch.All conceived in the same week, at the feast of the Monkey Dance.-You're welcome, but you probably won't get much sleep...Tonight's the night of the Monkey Dance!Please, sit down.Thanks.-Do I get anything to help me combat Tezcatlipoca?Like what?Well... a magical weapon?Get real, George...--Suppose I was to believe there was anything in your story - other than the rambling delusions of a seriously wacky old man.Suppose I was to swallow it hook, line and kitchen sink; what then?Then you would see that the fate of the human race rests upon your shoulders...Less than two weeks...!I didn't really believe that Tezcatlipoca would return.But I figured Karzac's plans were in some way connected.-The third stone, the Coyote stone, reached Spain safely.That is the stone in your possession.--They were taken by the Spanish to the coastal town that is now called Quaramonte City.Only one stone reached Spain - the other two fell into the hands of buccaneers.Tell me more about the Jaguar stone...Many centuries ago, the port of Quaramonte was entered by a ship flying Spanish colours.The captain, the man known as El Draco, sent soldiers ashore.Only when the soldiers arrested the mayor did the people realise that they were English privateers.The mayor was held hostage while the soldiers looted and plundered the city.Amongst the treasures that they stole was the Jaguar stone.Where is the Jaguar stone now?I suppose El Draco took it back to his homeland, across the great sea.-Tell me more about the Eagle stone...The stone was loaded onto a galleon with many valuable artefacts plundered by the Spanish.I don't suppose this would be any use to you...But shortly after leaving harbour, a terrible squall blew up and damaged the ship.The ship was intercepted by a blood-thirsty pirate, Captain Ketch.It sure would! This wax-on-a-stick will change our lives!Uh... what do you want it for?To decorate our bodies for the Monkey Dance!Ketch made short work of overpowering the crew, stealing the treasure, and sinking the Spanish ship.Where is the Eagle stone now?Nobody knows for sure...lText Resource 2949 r�����#Qqy����b��;Ch��g���-.IJxyz������e��������YjklmnoZ[Hey, senorita!Too late - I had been seen.Bonjour, captain.Ha! Only 'sergeant', pretty one. What are you doing here?Oh...Snuggles said I could come here with him.Snuggles?Oh! I mean the General. We're... ah, friends.Senor Karzac said I could help.Did he?Something about 'on the job training'.I'll bet he did!I managed to hold a smile for that pig.Auntie,.. I mean, La Presidenta...La Presidenta is your aunt?Mais, oui. Anyway, auntie said I could watch what cousin Raoul was doing.But you're not Quaramontean.Non, I was raised in France. It's a long story.May I go up the pyramid?Ah, we have strict instructions not to let anybody pass.Oh, but I've told you who I am. Surely nobody would mind?Well...Oh, please? I'd be ever so grateful.What's going on over there? Do you need help, my pretty?I'll tell you what. I'll ask Pablo if it's okay for you to go up...If Pablo saw me, I'd be dead.Ah, non. It's not worth the bother. I'm not really that interested in their stupid pyramid, anyway.Well, okay. It's men's work up there anyway.I'll just run along and play around here, okay?Okay, you do that.Nothing's wrong. I dropped - err - a cigarette butt.Everything is under control. I'll have the fire out in a minute or two.lText Resource 2933&���;��;��


I've had enough of your games, Collard.
Tell me what you've done with my stone!I thought your business was simply smuggling cocaine, Karzac!Why are you so interested in that stone?Enough! Either you tell me what I want to know or Pablo here will MAKE you talk!Okay. Well, I figured someone at the university would be able to help.I... I sent the stone to the department of ethnology - you know, I figured it was South American, so...That's enough! I don't have time to listen to your mindless prattle!We'll leave you to think it over. Come the morning you'll be ready to talk......but the Collard woman was there! They'll know it was me!But you have the stone? The right stone? You're sure?Yes, of course. It's the Jaguar stone, no possible mistake. Here it is...--Karzac. Please. The police will be looking for me soon. You're going to get me out of the country, aren't you?I thought you just wanted it to frighten the natives.Fool! I intend to cast this stone into the sea.But... why? It's unique.Exactly. With it gone, the Mayan priests' plan to destroy Tezcatlipoca cannot succeed.I can assure you that Tezcatlipoca is a mythical figure.Such a small mind you live in. Tezcatlipoca is real.So I had a word with one of my girl friends and she told me her boyfriend was a lecturer.Stop your whining, Oubier! Do you have any idea what this stone symbolizes?I have seen him in my dreams. We have spoken of his plans for this world.Oh... how interesting. Well, I'll just be getting along. I'll...We have spoken of your part in these plans.My part?He told me you would be useful. He told me how to crush your spirit by turning you to drugs.My wife died. You know that full well. She was my world, my everyth...And now you are no longer useful.She called out your name as she died, you know.What? What are you saying?And then they thought you'd done it. It all worked perfectly.You..? It was you? You bastard! You monster!-For the love of God, Karzac!Which one?You're not buying this, are you?lText Resource 1023lText Resource 1022


It was the masking tape that had been used on Nico.Ugly though it may have been, I was sure that I'd find a use for the creepy fetish.I decided to keep the masking tape - it was bound to be of some use to me.Nico!It was a grotesque little statue of a figure carrying a shield and a spear...That look in her eyes told me I'd better get the ropes untied - and fast!Nico was trussed up like a chicken but she didn't appear to be harmed...It was a short length of rope, tied tightly around Nico's slim wrists.-The door led back into the warehouse.lText Resource 1021b8c���Im��Z{�2g��+a������������������������p���5s�i��'	R	�	�	g

I decided to leave the electric eye alone.
I couldn't move the crate until I'd blocked the light beam with something else.
Nope, that wasn't going to help. Nico looked well considering her ordeal.I didn't want to risk dropping the crate and releasing its live contents.These doors were not going to open.There was no way to open that window.The window was not designed to open.Then I found a small round stud which was set flush to the surrounding wooden panelling.The short chain stopped the cuffs reaching from the statue to the winch.The doors had been smashed open.Just in time! Interrupting the beam of light kept the doors from closing......and stopped anyone from using the elevator! But what now...?I decided to leave the crate where it was.The rope was attached around the neck of the statue.The doorway opened onto a platform which projected out above the docks.The hidden door led to a secret room...Nothing happened. That was probably because the elevator was already on this floor.The label just wasn't sticky enough to stay in place.The worm may have been slimy, but it wasn't sticky.----------------------The large crate supported a smaller crate...The little crate was precariously balanced.The crate bore the familiar logo of Kondor Transglobal, but no clues to its contents.There! That would keep the doors from closing...Too heavy. I couldn't shift it, not even a inch.It was a large crate - with no label.No chance. Whatever those crates contained, they were heavy.The crate was labelled 'Danger - Live contents! Do not drop!'There were small holes in the top and sides and scratchy noises coming from inside...The crate was too heavy to lift safely, but it occurred to me that I could slide it.I was wrestling with the small crate when I noticed the label on its side.'Danger - Live contents! Do not drop!'But decided not to risk dropping it - and meeting the 'Live contents'.I realised the doors must lead to a loading platform high above the dockside...A sturdy beam was jammed across the doors.It was a device to prevent the elevator doors closing when they were obstructed.The masking tape I'd placed over the eye prevented the elevator doors from closing.Holding my hand in front of the eye would stop the doors from closing, but I couldn't stay like that forever...Hopefully the tape would prevent those doors from closing, and stop the Indian from being able to call the elevator.It was the elevator call button.Elevator doors. Any minute now that crazy Indian was going to burst out of them, and then...I had to move, and fast.The elevator doors were shut tight.It was a hydraulic hand cart.There wasn't enough room to move the handle...The pallet rose about six inches off the floor and I said a silent prayer to whoever had discovered the power of hydraulics.I guess the wheels of the cart were jammed or something.There didn't appear to be any difference in the panelling of this part of the wall...My fingers traced the outline of a secret door in the wall.Just as I'd hoped - a secret room!An unmarked switch. Tempting...It was the light switch.It was a pulley attached to a long rail which ran the length of the building.It wasn't much use, though. No rope.The pulley was useless without a rope.The rope and pulley were now attached to the statue.There wasn't much I could do with a pulley that didn't have any rope.I didn't want to remove the rope from the pulley.It would be much easier to attach the rope to the statue first...The rope wasn't long enough to reach the pulley...I noticed a faint mark on the wooden floor...There was a barely visible scratch mark on the floor.There was an arc shaped scratch on the floor, as if a door had been opened in the nearby wall.The statue looked as if it was Central or South American in origin.The statue looked way too heavy for me to move.It was too heavy for me to move on my own...---I didn't see a need to raise the cart again.-----I saw no reason to retrieve the rope.lText Resource 1667���`w���!Au�����;s��%Rq���-n���	=oy��W���4	`	�	�	(


I'd had enough of taunting Bronson.You know, hanging from flagpoles suits you.Get me down!Not until the old ladies have heard exactly what you had planned...What's the magic word?Please?Bad luck, I was thinking of 'Alakazam'.Hey - get out of there!You know, wherever I go, I hear those words.Paris, Syria, Ireland or Spain, makes no difference.What do you think you're doing?I was trying to show some interest in your project.Get away from my stuff, y'hear?Okay, okay. It's cool.Okay!Hi! Is this Ketch's Landing?Yeah, right. What brings you here, anyway?He wouldn't have wanted that...What's that you're waving about?Dammit, I'm going to have to go through all that again.Not this time. The house is locked up and the sisters aren't here.Hell's teeth! I'll have to put the spare target on the other flagpole!A whole morning's work wasted!Aaaargh!I'm searching for an ancient Mayan artefact.What is it - some kinda jewel?No, it's obsidian. A black stone with supposedly mystic powers.You're nuts.What'cha doing, Bronson? Just hanging around?I'm going to kill you for this, Stobbart! Get me down from here!What? So you can kill me? Gee, you talked me out of it, Bronson.I felt a little guilty about leaving Bronson up there......but not much, obviously. I had no more to talk to him about.Can I take a look at your plans?No way! What interest would they be to you, anyhow?I've always had a secret desire to be a surveyor!You have?Sure - I mean, you surveyors are just like the great explorers, aren't you?Henry the Navigator, Vasco de Gama, Chris Columbus...Maybe you don't sail uncharted seas or discover new continents, but you're okay in my book!Horse shit! You just stay away from those plans, you hear?I've got your plans, Bronson. I know about the hotel.So what? This is between me and the dames.Those sweet old ladies trusted you. This isn't what they wanted!People like them don't know what they want.Instead of wasting their money on this mausoleum, I can turn it to profit!But you should have discussed it with them first!If I was to let you down, will you promise to come clean about your plans?Sure I will.And you'll come to a tasteful compromise with Miss Frost and Miss Mina?Taste? What's taste got to do with architecture?Oh, dear. You'll have to stay where you are until you see sense...You rat!What do you think of Rio?Tell me about the two old ladies...What are you doing with the theodolite?Surveying the old house. I got great plans for this place...Oh, yeah?You bet. Take a look around... What do you see?Paradise.I see... Opportunity. This place is ripe for development!I like it just the way it is.And that's where we differ. You see, Mr Stobbart - I'm what you might call a man of vision.I see a great future for Ketch's Landing, and it all starts here, with that house...I really don't care.------Hey, get me down!You're a practical man - what would you use this metal cone for?Hmm. Interesting. What's its volume?How should I know?The volume of a cone is equal to one third of its base area multiplied by its height.I'll try to remember that.This is similar to the stone I'm looking for...I'm looking for a stone, similar to this one.What makes you think you'll find it here?Because when the stones were stolen in the seventeenth century...Hold it! The stones have been lost for three hundred years?Approximately.And you're hoping to find them again? You're nuts! And why here?A wise old Indian shaman told me he saw the stones in a vision...Ha, ha. That's rich. Listen - I got work to do, okay.Catch you later, Bronson.What do you think of my fish?Where did you get that?Out of the ocean. It must live there, I guess.Smartass! Why are you carrying a dead fish?It's dead? Aw...!There's something unusual about this ball.It's covered in cat spit.Gee. Imagine my excitement.Look at this - an article about a total eclipse of the sun.Oh, yeah? Listen - I don't want to be rude, but it just comes naturally.Say - was that kid giving you trouble?The fisher boy? No, he was very polite.Ha! He's a juvenile delinquent!I suppose he told you I was a crook?Yeah, he did, now you mention it. Oh, no. He's a good kid. He'd never say anything like that.-They speak pretty highly of you.Fish boy? If he comes near me again, I'll throttle the little squirt!Calm down! What's he ever done to you?Socked me in the back of my skull with some kinda fish, that's what!Yeah, that's right.My name's George Stobbart. You're a surveyor, right, Mister..?Bronson  - and of course I'm a surveyor. Why the hell else would I have a theodolite?I don't know. A hobby maybe.How do you survey a house like that?I've put a target reflector on the end of one of the flagpoles up there on the house......I sight on it from various locations through the theodolite, record the angles along the base line......and triangulate them to give me the exact position of the target, understand?Why the end of the flagpole? Wouldn't it have been better on a corner of a wall or something?Are you a surveyor?No, my degree's in law.Then shut up.One of 'em's crazy as a coot and the other'll turn you to stone if you're not careful!-One of these days that kid's going to have a boating accident......even if I have to hold his head under myself.Sure he would, the little punk.Hey, get away from there right now!And stay out!What the hell's going on here?Hi, Bronson, nice to see you, too.You again. Have you been screwing around with my theodolite target?Where is it? I had to climb out of the window to put that one on.I'm going to fix all this and then I'm going to fix you, y'hear?Yeah? Fine, I'll be waiting.Did you see the sisters go by?Yeah, they wanted to string that fisher brat up!Course, I told them where to find him.A fink as well as a creep. Nice.But he'd managed to vanish somehow.--Who? The Ketch sisters?Of course they do.

We weren't allowed near the docks.That's right. Usually, we meet the ships when they tie up.We play to the tourists.-Well, when the Kondor ship came in, we were told to go away!---Why don't you try playing a tune to cheer yourselves up?--No. We should be looking for real jobs.We could earn ten times as much down the mines...---------My cousin Ramirez was earning eight pesos an hour!Before he lost his legs in the accident...Tell me about the accident at the mine...There was an explosion at Teoculcan.Thirty miners were buried alive.They got some of them out, though.Two of them, including your cousin, and they left half of him behind.--Tell me about the General...You know - the guy in charge around here?We don't want to talk about him, se�or.How come? No-one can hear you... only that old goat!In Quaramonte, we have a saying.Don't tell your old goat what you don't want your wife to know.What does that mean?I don't know.Would either of you guys care for a biscuit?A dog biscuit, se�or?Are you trying to insult us?No - really. They're good.We'll take your word for it.I decided to leave it.Why was Miguel put in jail?Have you any idea what this is?No, se�or.Me neither.For playing folk music.What?Have you seen anything like...Ai! The Hungry Chief!Why are you carrying that thing about with you, se�or?Don't you know who it is?Sure - it's Tezcatlipoca. But it's only a little carving...It brings death, se�or! Death and destruction!What do you make of this little worm?No good. It's dead.Sure it's dead. You think I'd carry it around in my pocket if it wasn't?Take a look at the design on this label...I have seen that before.Where?There was a ship flying a flag just like that...When did you see this ship?Three months ago. It was here, at the docks.Do you guys know anything about a total eclipse?What is it?It's like when the sun is hidden by the moon.He's crazy!My cousin Alfredo swears he saw it happen once...But that was after he stupidly consumed a cocktail of peyote and antibiotics.--------It's true, se�or. He insisted on playing traditional Quaramontean music, even though it's illegal.

The path was blocked by an ugly and extremely dangerous looking boar.
That boar wasn't going to move unless I made him...Not interested. I guess the taste of "Gourmet Dog" was too sophisticated for him.Instead of sending him to sleep, the dart had made him really mad!There wasn't much point in using an empty hollow reed on a wild boar.I couldn't get close enough to stick the dart in him.It was a stout overhanging branch.If I jumped, I could just about reach the branch.Climbing the tree wasn't going to help any in this situation.That branch had helped me all it was going to.Not far away, I could see Camel's Hump hill.It was the short cut back to the Camel's Hump.The branch wasn't as strong as I had thought.Assuming I could manage not to wander off the path, it lead back to the cliff top.Yet another path lead off into the forest.The path lead to the clearing with the needle of rock.The boar's expression said, "Forget it, Stobbart".The boar looked determined to stop me from getting past.The path was blocked by a small, but nevertheless dangerous looking boar.lText Resource 1546P=��Acv��Lw���!X���)Rr��	[��5��Ij���	G	t	�	�	



...and then it goes, 'Fa fa fa faaa, fa fa fa fa faaa fa'.And, when you were in this band of yours, you used to play that song for two hours?Yeah, we were really famous at our college. Still, ours wasn't as good as the original version.I have never heard the song before, yet I have no doubt that this must be true.I'm George Stobbart.

Well, that's something.They'll have to arrange an 'accident' for you instead.I was trying to warn the workers at the mine, se�or.You knew about the explosion?Is there somewhere you can hide from the General?But how are you going to break out of here with just a short piece of rope?NOT USED (See ds) Hey!

I overheard the General planning it.-If your plan doesn't work will you let me hang myself in peace?-Hey! Miguel!What is it? What is happening?We're getting out of here!Who's 'we'? They've sent the Delta Force?Nope.Have you heard of a guy called Karzac?Yes. The old man spoke of him.Who then?A retired greetings card salesman from Ohio.I'm doomed.You're not the only one.The foreigner - Professor Oubier?Look, I can explain everything...Get in that cell! Now!Very wise, Norteamericano scum!And what if I refuse?He'll shoot you.Okay, here I am, going quietly into the cell.I hope you're enjoying your vacation, se�or Stobbart.One of the reasons I hate guns so much is the way they make people so damned impolite.Go polish your weapon, Renaldo.This was part of your plan, right?Well, in a manner of speaking, no.I was all out of ideas. It was up to Nico now.That's right. This man Karzac is Oubier's boss.The Impossible Missions Force?Don't make me sick. Much better.There was nothing I wanted to talk about right then.Listen to me, Miguel.

Please, forgive my mother. She can be a little... difficult.Oh, my feet. Raoul! Propose, you idiot.Don't mind her, she just wants grandchildren.Oh, but she did. She spoke to her son as if he were a failed genetics experiment.Don't think I can't hear you, Raoul. I want a worthy successor and you're not it.She doesn't mean that.I hated being in her presence. There was something just so poisonous and selfish about her.-----Raoul, this girl's pretty and bright in a shallow way. She would make an ideal daughter-in-law.Propose now or I'll do it for you.Look, Nico, we haven't known each other very long but...What the hell was that?!I didn't know what was going on but George had to be involved in it somewhere.{Nearby crash of collapsing masonry}Raoul! There's something suspicious going... The sacrifice! Where is it?Nico was here with Titipoco. They set him free. I couldn't stop them.You idiot! I should have strangled you at birth!Titipoco's gone soft! He wouldn't have hurt you!I know that.The darkness of the sun is almost upon us and we have no sacrifice to appease Tezcatlipoca!Have you any idea what your incompetence will cost us?I think so. And I'm glad.What?The Mayans weren't fools. Tezcatlipoca should stay exactly where they put him.Finally got some backbone from somewhere, eh? Shame it's so late in the day.I'd rather die than see you and Karzac with that devil's power.Fine - we're still a sacrifice short.See! The eclipse begins! Pablo, kill him! Tezcatlipoca can feed upon his yellow heart.Nico was right all along. But it's still not too late.Come on, then, Pablo! Let's see who sacrifices who!lText Resource 1541_/���



The marker was a bright, shiny thing and I have a weakness for bright shiny things.A cute lil' puddy tat! Actually, no. It was a mangy old flea bag.Hi, puss! Wanna play?Hey, cat! Watch where you're putting those claws!I wasn't going to risk further laceration by the cat's claws.The cat made short work of the feather, tearing it into a blizzard of small pieces.The quill had been mutilated by the cat leaving shredded feather on the grass.No, I wouldn't take away the cat's new toy.At least, not until I'd got something out of it.It was busily torturing a red ball.Hey, cat - wanna play with this little doll?It wasn't exactly enthralled at coming face to face with the great god Tezcatlipoca...Okay, cat - you don't deserve this, but here's a little fish...The cat looked at me as if to say: 'Why have you brought a dead worm halfway around the world?'I had no answer.I could have loaded the cat into the inner tube and launched it out to sea... 'Catapult', get it? Oh, Stobbart, you kill me sometimes. Bronson was examining the marker...The flagpole had some sort of technical gadget on the end.It would have been pretty cool to drug the cat.But I didn't have the heart. And besides which, those sisters would kill me.I doubted the cat would have salient remarks to make on a Meso-American artefact.I was right. The house of Captain Ketch, the scourge of the Caribbean.It looked like it could use a coat of paint...It was the old house. I felt a tingle of apprehension as I prepared to enter Ketch's house.The last time he'd left that house, it was to walk to his death on the sands below.It was locked.A large tree stood beside the house, with a suggestive 'U' formed by the branches.It was a pretty strong flagpole to support Bronson's weight. I couldn't reach it. Bronson looked about as pleased as could be expected. It was a flagpole, one of a pair. I couldn't think of any reason to climb the tree.I didn't have a flag on me so the flagpole would have to stay bare. I was quite happy to leave him there even if he wasn't. The flagpole had a reflective target on the end for Bronson to use as a reference point. I couldn't reach the flagpole and a bush stopped me from moving the ladder across.The flagpole looked a lot better without the target on it. There was nothing else I wanted to do with the flagpole. Maybe I had a future as a surrealist artist. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea after all...That should get the old cat dancing.I just hoped it didn't give itself a cardiac...I do believe that old cat was enjoying playing with the bouncy fish...I didn't want to risk the wrath of that vicious animal by putting my hand within striking distance of those claws.The inner tube hung between the two branches. The novelty value of having an inner tube in my pocket had worn off. I left it there. I put the ball in the catapult......took aim...Yes!Okay, so it was a lucky shot.But I'd knocked the theodolite target clean off the end of the flagpole!It was a sturdy extendible ladder. The ladder extended easily. Bronson could stay up there until he learned some morals and some manners.The ladder reached all the way up to the flagpole.It was the ball the cat had left in favour of the bouncing fish.Pussy want his ball back? Yeah?Pussy could go whistle for it. It might come in handy elsewhere.The steps led back down to the beach.It was an old house.I'd have to do that from the ground.Bronson was dangling from the flagpole like the worm on Rio's fishing pole.The reflector looked just fine where it was.It was a closed window.Just my luck. I'd struck out again.A large tree stood beside the house.Two old ladies were sitting outside the house, enjoying afternoon tea.--Nah, I didn't have the throwing strength to knock the marker off.-It was Frost and Mina.Meow!I put my lucky lump of coal in the catapult...It wasn't going to be much use without the theodolite, though.Here's another little fish...Here cat, here's a little fish...I doubted I had Rio's grasp of piscine aerodynamics.There had to be a better projectile than a dead fish.Maybe in my high school days but not now.No!My lucky piece of coal vanished into the distance.It looked like it was going into orbit.The little monster ate the fish but never strayed far from the ball.It was Bronson's surveying target. He must have dropped it when he had his 'accident'.The house's windows looked out over the bay.The windows were way out of reach.-The windows were all locked.If I could get up to them, maybe I could climb in that way.The window was locked.No, I couldn't just go around throwing things at other peoples' windows.lText Resource 1538o��U��={�-a��	6V����Pn�9Eo���	�	�	�	�	�	�	�	�	�	�	�	�	�	�	�	�	�	o�	�	�	�	�	�	�

It was half a rusting bicycle frame.The only serviceable part of the bicycle's wreck was a rubber inner-tube.You just never know when you're gonna need stuff like that...There was nothing else on the bicycle wreck I could use.It was a sea-worthy little craft, in bad need of a coat of paint but spotlessly clean and maintained.I didn't know the first thing about sailing a dinghy.With Bronson out of the way, I could finally get a clear look at the plans.I wasn't going anywhere in that boat without Rio to sail her.The guy was doing something technical with his theodolite.At least, I guess he was. To me, it seemed like he was just looking through it.The guy was studying a large document.Bronson was looking through the theodolite again...Bronson was studying his drawing.There was a battered old wood and brick house overlooking the bay.  It was the Ketch museum, based in Captain Ketch's actual house. I just had to sneak a look at those plans...It looked like a set of plans. It was a net left to dry in the sunshine.Engineers' drawings didn't mean much to me...I didn't want a fishing net.The kid looked about eleven or twelve.He was fishing with the intense concentration of someone who had all the time in the world...Rio had gone back to fishing.I recognised the instrument as a theodolite, but I had no idea how to operate it.I couldn't get to the theodolite while the surveyor was using it...Bronson wasn't going to let me use his theodolite...It was Rio.The steps led up to the top of the cliff.The steps led up to the museum.But one thing was clear: these plans were for a five storey, two hundred roomed, luxury pirate-themed hotel!Another stain on the bedspread of Paradise...lText Resource 3257f� :�_�P\jqy���R���������


Intrepid adventurers George and Nico are embroiled in another mysterious escapade of brutality, calamity and immortality...

After an encounter with a pair of Central American Indians, I had been knocked out and my girlfriend abducted.
They failed in their attempts to kill me, and after carefully piecing together the clues, I eventually ended up on a desolate dockside in Marseilles where I hoped I would find Nico.
Getting past the night watchman and his dog had been easy.

Little did I know that I was soon to be pitted against truly terrifying adversaries - ruthless drug barons from the present day, and bloodthirsty Mayan gods from many centuries ago.

Evil spells and brutal reprisals haunt them as they face their most sinister challenge to date.
As the threatening darkness of an eclipse smothers all, the chance discovery of a sinister drugs ring reveals the arcane power of an ancient civilisation.Torment, terror, sacrificial rituals and bloody massacre are unearthed beneath a veil of Mayan mystery.

Kidnap, stolen treasure, deadly drug barons and political intrigue are the least of the intrepid duo's worries, as divine forces threaten to annihilate mankind!
Nerve, cunning and guile are essentials in order to conquer this compelling adventure, guaranteed to leave you with an aching brain and a pulsing heart...



It was an old chocolate vending machine.The machine needed to be fed a coin before it would operate.An ancient bar of chocolate dropped into the tray at the bottom of the machine.There was a narrow gap between the cupboard door and the wooden frame.A latch lock stopped me getting into the cupboard.I pushed the hairclip into the slot and whatever was stuck there disappeared into the machine.I remembered my student days when I regularly forgot my house keys.The blade of the dagger just fitted between the door and the soft wood frame.The train signal lights still worked.A warning sign saying 'high voltage' convinced me to leave the lights alone.'lbs'? Lerbs? What are lerbs? The machine wasn't about to weigh me for nothing. I put the old penny into the slot, the needle twitched rustily and the machine spat out a card.The weight was in Imperial units. It meant nothing to me. It was the small, stiff card from the weighing machine.It was an old Imperial penny, the kind the British used before the twentieth century caught up with them.The train was my ride out of there.The train didn't even slow down.I could worry about not having a ticket when I got to the docks.I couldn't jump on a moving train.Wow!...in an abandoned London Underground station!This place must have been closed down decades ago!The card also had my fortune on it. 'A family quarrel will turn out to your advantage'.'1d only' was embossed below the coin slot.Something protruded slightly from the slot.The slot was much too thin for my fingers.And as a special bonus the penny dropped through to the reject pocket!It was a cup which caught rejected coins.I pulled out an old English penny.A flap covered the tray into which the machine dispensed chocolate bars.I took the ancient bar of chocolate.The tray was empty.The blade was too thick for the narrow slot.There was no point in going back up there.It was a maintenance cupboard.The door gave slightly - and then held firm.A small crack had appeared where the dagger had pried the door from its frame.My fingers were too big to reach into the tiny crack.The blade of the dagger was too thick to get into the narrow crack.A wiggle with the thick card between the frame and the lock, and the latch lifted.The hairgrip was too thick to fit into the crack.It was the stairs leading back up to the museum.The cup was empty.The card just bent when I tried to force it down the edge of the cupboard door.The card wouldn't lock it again.Wrecking the box wasn't going to help me.The hairgrip wasn't going to help matters here.I had the feeling something weird awaited me if I went that way.It was a poster, advertising holidays in Scotland.It might have been a nice souvenir if it hadn't been torn and dirty.The poster was advertising a play I'd never heard of.The date on the poster was before I was born.It was an old map of the London Underground.It looked just like the modern one.It was an old ticket machine. A sign read 'Tickets - 3d'.The machine looked like it had sold its last ticket a long time ago.It was the tunnel the train had come out of.It was a tube tunnel - possibly still in use.It was too dangerous to start walking along the tracks.I remembered what always happened to Wile E. Coyote when he did that.A pile of old railway sleepers was blocking the platform.I'd probably break my neck if I climbed over the sleepers ... or worse - a heel.The ghost didn't seem threatening in any way.The ghost obviously didn't want to talk.Perhaps it was shy.I didn't want to get the hairgrip jammed in the slot.I stumbled down dark stairwells for what seemed like forever until, suddenly, I found myself...It was a big, red, ever-so-tempting button.I'd heard of 'stabbing buttons' but that was going too far.If I closed the cupboard, the ticket might not open it again.One bar of antique chocolate was more than enough for me.There was nothing in the cupboard except for a red button.There was a copper coin in the cup.Through the crack, I could just make out the latch which stopped the door from opening.The penny was too large to fit into the slot.


Great! I had no idea where I was, no idea where the others had got to and time was running out to stop Karzac.
There was a huge doorway in the far wall.The door had been blocked with a great, sliding slab of stone.Another doorway led out of the room.The doorway was sealed with a massive slab of stone.-There was a lever on the wall.A stone slab that must have weighed tons sealed the door.Still, I wasn't dead yet so it wasn't all bad news.My old torch was dying and I had no desire to be plunged into darkness. The torch was fine where it was.Once more, into the unknown...Yes! Finally! I'm out of here...The torch didn't look like it was going to burn for much longer.There was an unused torch up on the wall.The torch could stay there until I really needed it.Beyond the secret door was nothing but gloom.lText Resource 1596%��,d���!���5>���P|��Ai�.Of��*q���������������!"#$%&'(,AF�����������The Xibalba Princess lay at anchor just below Tower Bridge.I knew I'd found the right ship as soon as I saw Pablo at the rail!It was the door to the boat's main cabin.

I suppose the Thames was under it somewhere. A guard patrolled the deck. He was sure to be armed.A ladder gave access to the cabin's roof.A mop for swabbing the deck stood against the wall. Pablo, Karzac's pet sadist.Got you.The crate was a good hiding place but I couldn't stay there forever.It was the first crate I had hidden behind. I couldn't open the crate and I couldn't move it.The crate sheltered me from unfriendly eyes.It was risky but I thought I could get to the next crate unseen.The crate was sealed and too heavy to move.It was a porthole to the main cabin. I couldn't get near it with that guard patrolling the deck.I needed to get closer, not further away.I couldn't make it to the gangplank without being seen. Pablo would probably shoot me on sight.I wasn't going in there until I knew if anyone was inside.It was Tower Bridge, a magnificent mess of mock-Gothic architecture and Victorian engineering.My business was here, not on Tower Bridge.I couldn't let the guard see me.It was a heavy crate. The guard would be suspicious if I moved the mop.I didn't think I had time to get up the ladder before the guard reappeared.I didn't think I had time to get the mop before the guard reappeared.It was the Tower of London. Originally built by the French, naturally.I was too busy to play the tourist.Metal hooks had been welded onto each side of the door frame.The cupboard stored a collection of cleaning materials.lText Resource 1572����5n��@d���=GPo����8���T������b����


The house is closed!How come?It is undergoing refurbishment.
Refurbishment? Where are the workmen?Listen, ma'am - I came a long way to visit this place...Now, what did you want?If we make an exception in your case, everyone will want to get in.Pardon me, but I didn't exactly have to fight my way through the crowds...You're the second visitor we've had today!No, I'm sorry, but it's impossible.You there! What are you doing?Pardon me, ladies. I was just going to climb your ladder.I'm helping Bronson.Ooh, you're not like him, are you? He's very polite, isn't he, Frost?And he has dimples when he smiles...Get down!Sorry...Hi! My name's George Stobbart.Good afternoon, Mister Stobbart. Would you care for tea?No, thank you, ma'am. I don't like tea.--I think you ought to know that Bronson is not what he seems...Is that so?No, he's a common crook.First you cast aspersions on the memory of our ancestor, and now you say Mr Bronson is a 'crook'!What were your ancestors, Mister Stobbart? Rebel minutemen?My mother's family came from Scotland...I might have guessed! Well, why have you suddenly decided to slander Mister Bronson?Listen, he plans to turn your museum into a hotel!Piffle!Is that your cat?Yes, it is.That's Ruddles.Do you like cats, Mister Stobbart?Not when they draw blood. Do you think I need a tetanus shot?I can assure you, sir, that dear old Ruddles carries no infections!Maybe not, but it's a vicious, bad-tempered brute.No, I don't.I thought not.You bet! Especially spit roast...Look! I love your cat so much, I went and got him a fish!If I thought for a moment that it was a pure and altruistic act, I would be impressed.I love 'em! They're so cute with their claws and their little puckered butts...What can you tell me about Emily?Emily? What business can she be of yours?Her parents were killed in a typhoon.We, as her only living relatives, took it upon ourselves to raise the child.It's good to know charity isn't dead...Oh, but she is. Washed overboard in the typhoon!Mr Stobbart wasn't talking about Emily's mother, he was being sarcastic.What else can you tell me about Emily?How dare you pry into our family in this way?But?I refuse to answer any more of your impertinent questions.But a more cynical attempt to play on our sympathies, I cannot easily imagine.I thought I saw a little girl down on the beach...You must be mistaken.He must be mistaken. Mustn't he, Frost?I'm sure I'm not... a little girl and that young fisherboy.What!?! It's not possible! What... what were they doing?The kind of things that all little boys and girls get up to at their age...-When I was a little girl we used to play cows and milkmaids...Woe betide you if you're lying to us, Mr Stobbart. Heaven help you.With a creak of ancient corsetry the sisters sailed majestically over the distant horizon...Can you tell me anything about Captain Ketch?More than you can tell me about your great-great-great-great grandfather, no doubt.You're his descendants?Certainly. Captain Ketch was born in Dorset, England, in the reign of King Henry the Eighth.His family were undistinguished farmers, but young Frederick Ketch decided to go to sea.We have plenty of seamen in our family, Mr Stobbart!Are you interested in history, Mr Stobbart?Yes, I am.Heck, no. In my experience, history can be very dangerous for your health.You were telling me about Captain Ketch. Do go on...Oh, yes. He sailed under Hawkins...Jim Hawkins?John Hawkins, one of the great traders of the Elizabethan age.In 1568 Frederick Ketch was a young man, serving aboard the 'Jesus', Hawkins' flag ship.They sailed from England to Africa, and across the wide Atlantic to these islands.Ketch was never to see the shores of England again.How come Ketch never made it home?Because the Spaniards sank the Jesus in an act of treachery.Really? How very foolish of you.Oh, of course. This must be the place Bronson's surveying.I can!Be quiet, Mina.Preparation is half the work, young man.The intention is to prepare the museum for the new century.It's a museum?He didn't know it was a museum, Frost. We should have a sign.'The Frederick Ketch Memorial Museum'.It would look nice in neon!A museum for a pirate?There was a stony silence.Frederick Ketch was emphatically not a pirate!It's precisely this sort of vile misrepresentation that Mr Bronson is seeking to rebalance.Oh? How?Mr Bronson has kindly agreed to undertake the museum's refurbishment at a very reasonable price.He understands the importance of a sense of history.Funny, that's not the impression I got of Bronson at all.He also understands spherical geometry.Mina...Well, he does.Aren't they, though?Don't encourage him, Mina.There was nothing else I wanted to ask the sisters.That man is planning to build a huge hotel. Bronson is a confidence trickster!They wouldn't appreciate it...You said Hawkins' fleet traded between Africa and the Indies...What was it they were trading?Black men! With no shirts!You have to understand, Mr Stobbart, that this was the sixteenth century.That doesn't alter the fact that Hawkins and Ketch were slavers and pirates.Would it surprise you to learn that Hawkins was also a devoutly religious man?He transported slaves in a ship named after Jesus Christ?In my book that makes him a hypocrite.--What happened to Ketch? Was he killed?Oh, no. He got away, and returned to this island, to this very house.The Frederick Ketch Memorial Museum.It's a museum? That could be just what I'm looking for!Is it true Frederick Ketch was a pirate?Frederick Ketch sounds like he was a pirate to me!They hanged him, you know. Down there on the beach, in front of his family.Didn't bother with a trial, just whipped him out from his breakfast table and hoisted him up in chains.I tell you I've seen the plans.Bronson doesn't intend to rebuild the museum!He wants to turn it into a hotel!Ooh, what fun!An hotel?With a swimming pool and a casino.This place will look like Las Vegas if he gets his way!Over my rotting corpse!Here - Bronson's plans.This means nothing to me.She's not wearing her reading glasses...Ah - wait! Yes, I see now. I see it all too clearly!Mina, we have been duped. I'm glad we didn't sign his contract!I've been talking to Rio - the little fisherboy...I'll thank you not to mention that little wretch in my presence!Dirty little whelk! Nasty, fishy boy.That will do, Mina.I gather you don't have much time for the little boy?That child is a delinquent, Mister Stobbart.Yeah, well - he's only, what... eleven, maybe...?A knave with one hand on the tarts!What is it about Rio that you don't like, Miss Frost?Well, once upon a time, he and Emily...Okay, it was time for diversionary tactics.Mina, the lock.-----As I have already told you, sir, he was NOT a pirate!--Can I interest you in a fine, fresh fish, madam?I never touch fish, Mr Stobbart.--Hello, ladies.Look, Frost! That man with the floppy hair is back!--I think not. Get your cheap thrills elsewhere, you, you... American!Ooh, I say! Steady, Frost!--You're really fond of that cat, aren't you?He is our companion and our solace.I thought about catnapping the little monster until they let me in but it wasn't my style.Maybe there was some other way I could use their affection for the cat to get me into the house.Well, if he wasn't a pirate, what did they hang him for?Envy! Pure, green-eyed envy!He had been a successful privateer, you see, and had accumulated great wealth.As rich as a mink in a paddock.Shut up, Mina.Yes, Frost.The small minded governor and his lackies wanted his money......trumped up some ridiculous charge about breaking the conditions of his letter of marque......and hanged him like a common thief! The blackguards!'Letter of marque'?The document that permitted him to engage and destroy the enemies of the Crown.The difference between a lawful privateer and a pirate.Yo ho!Sorry, Frost.Well, why didn't Ketch just say, 'Take a hike, guys, I've got a pirating license'?Frederick Ketch was not a pirate!But he did show them his letter of marque.-But they destroyed it and hanged him anyway.--Why is Bronson so interested in this place?MISTER Bronson has a great interest in history. It wounded him to see this house falling into disrepair.With great personal generosity, he has undertaken to renovate the house.You haven't signed anything have you?Not yet. What are you insinuating, Mr Stobbart?Oh, nothing.Yet. But I had a feeling that 'great personal generosity' wasn't what was motivating Bronson.Young man!Okay, I know.Oh, I hate tricksters! Especially confident ones.Come, Mina!Mr Bronson! You may consider yourself persona non grata.Yes!

It was an enormous stone doorway.
The door was sealed by a massive stone slab.
Another huge stone doorway.A stone slab sealed off the doorway.To the left of the door was a stone lever. There was a stone lever to the right of the doorway.Lovely. Looks like my school gym teacher.The statue looked like it doubled as an incense burner.Charming.lText Resource 1574	-k����A��



Everytime I think this place can't get any spookier, it does.
An impressively lintled doorway.I couldn't get through that slab with my bare hands.
Impressive architecture.The doorway had been sealed.There was a lever mounted on the wall.Another one of those stone levers.'How rapouche.' The carving reminded me of Laine for some reason.There was nothing I could do to the carving, even if I'd wanted to. Which I didn't.lText Resource 1581��?x�����Bci�����Iz����Pj��O��������P���


I'm sorry, miss, but I shall have to ask you to stay.
Oh, but surely you don't suspect me of stealing the stone?
No, but you will have to make a statement to the police.
You're a witness.
Please, miss - don't go.
Okay.
And where do you think you're going?
I have to find a toilet...
You're staying right here until the police arrive.
Then you have nothing to worry about.
Get away from that door! Please.Okay!Can I help you, miss?It's okay, I'm just looking around.It didn't look anything like the Coyote stone.---Do you know if this mirror has any relevance to Tezcatlipoca?Excuse me, miss.  Please don't touch the exhibits.What can you tell me about the 'scrying mirror'?Ah, there's someone here who'll be able to help you better than me...Professor Oubier!Eh? What?You two know each other, do you?This young lady has some questions to ask, professor. I think she's from France...What is a scrying mirror?It's rather like a crystal ball, only you can't see anythin' in it.Apparently, he 'ad a partner who used it to talk with angels.If you ask me, 'e were barkin' mad.Have you ever heard of an English sea captain called El Draco?Indeed, miss. We have a couple of artefacts he brought back from one of his journeys.-------Don't you think it's suspicious that Oubier has urgent business at the docks?Not in the slightest, young lady. He's gone to oversee the unloading of cargo.An exhibition of Mayan sculpture on loan from Mexico City.What's the name of the ship?The Xibalba Princess.Ah! That belonged to the alchemist and part-time Elizabethan spy, Dr John Dee.Hello?I knew I had nothing to worry about if the police were called...Yes, I'll hold.But I had to catch up with Oubier - and fast.------There was nothing else I wanted to ask him just then.This one was like a little black shaving mirror.Come along, miss. I'll show you the mirror.There! John Dee's famous scryin' mirror, given to him by Francis Drake!Can I take a closer look at Dee's mirror, please?No, you cannot! That's why the cabinet is locked.They tried some new-fangled interactive scheme and you can guess what happened...Bloody kids ran off with 'alf the exhibits!Hands-on experience, my foot... In my days it was hands off!I ask you - what do kids know about ancient Mayan civilisation? Nothing.I didn't steal the stone. I was nowhere near it!So who do you suppose did steal it?It must have been Oubier.Ha! Begging your pardon, but he's a man of letters. A professor!So was Moriarty. Man of letters or not, he's your culprit.It must have been the Japanese girls!Did you see them touch the cabinet?Not exactly... but they're laughing about something!All girls giggle - especially Japanese ones.It was you, wasn't it?Use your loaf, miss! What would I want with an ancient Mayan artefact?I don't know, but I'm sure the police will get it out of you!I didn't think the museum attendant would be interested in a hairgrip.Look at this - the thief left this key in the cabinet.Oh, dear. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. That make the theft an inside job, right?Oh, dear.In other words, the thief was Professor Oubier!Well, let's leave that for police to decide, shall we?Take a look at this...Are you threatening me, miss?Don't be ridiculous. I just wanted to ask you about this knife.What are you doing with that?Just looking. What was it used for?It's a sacrificial dagger and I'd feel a lot happier if you put it down!Thank you. You've been most helpful.I'd better phone them right away.You'll have to be quick, miss, I'm on the phone.Can you answer me some questions about the 'Jaguar Stone'?Certainly, miss. If you'd just step this way...It's gone! Some sod's 'alf-inched it!Professor Oubier, your taxi is 'ere.If you'll excuse me, I have some urgent business to attend to at the docks.---Moored down by Tower Bridge. Why do you ask?--Hmm. Just wondering.But I haven't done anything!I'd never catch Oubier if I didn't get out of there quickly.{Telephone rings}Excuse me. The telephone...-He wouldn't have been interested.El Draco? Not a very English name.I think that's what the Spanish would have called him. It was about the time of the conquistadors.Sixteenth century? Oh, I know! That's what the Spanish called Sir Francis Drake!Francis Drake? Have you got anything here that belonged to him?What was it you wanted?Is the scrying mirror the only piece of obsidian Drake gave Dee?Funny you should ask. There's another called the 'Jaguar Stone'.Dee never liked it, though. Said there were angels in the mirror......but devils in that stone.It was brought back from the New World by Sir Francis Drake and presented to him.It's Mayan, y'know?What can you tell me about that stone with the jaguar on it?Can you tell me something about the 'Jaguar Stone'?Certainly, miss.The so-called 'Jaguar Stone' was brought back from the Americas by Sir Francis Drake and presented......with, as you already know, the more famous 'scrying mirror'......to John Dee.The old loony didn't like the stone though. Reckoned it was tainted by the devil.I've already... oh, never mind.Who? Tezcitli... Tezclatli... I can't even say it!...along with the more famous 'scrying mirror'...What's this 'scrying mirror'?It's a little square of polished obsidian. Mayan, it is.And what does it do?Well, it's a bit like a crystal ball. Except flat. And black. And you can't see anything in it.Old man Dee had a sidekick who reckoned he could speak to the angels through it.I think he was taking Dee for a ride, myself.Not even a cute one like this.Half-inched...?Stolen it, miss! Never mind, the silent alarm will have been tripped.I'm afraid nobody can leave until our crack security team gets here.How long will that take?Could be a while. I think it's their tea break.The thief could be miles away by then!Don't you worry about that, miss. Just don't try to leave.It was too much of a coincidence that Oubier showed up and the stone promptly disappeared.I didn't have time for their 'crack security team' to finish their tea. I had to get after him!lText Resource 3114Z A��(9Z��.Y|��Mn���en���Y���@s��ARg{��			8	L	k	~	�	�	�	�	


The shaman wants to talk to you.I hoped he would. Well, it's been nice to talk to you guys...There wasn't much point in sending the empty box back to the shaman...No. There's no-one of that description here.So? Everyone in my family has been bitten by snakes.If you say so...I'm from the same planet as you!Father Hubert said there was a wise man in the village who could help me...Oh, he must mean the old man, the shaman.I thought he just made up all those stories he tells. I never thought of him as being wise...My girl friend has been bitten by a snake.I was bitten by a dormouse once...She's real sick. I hoped your wise man might have medicine.Wise man? You must have the wrong village.Are you going to stand by and let my girl friend die?We'll start the preparations for a cremation feast.I had nothing else to ask about.What do you do for entertainment here in... the jungle?We make documentaries.Here - I've found some more of those biscuits for the shaman.I'd like to see the shaman, please.You can't just go walking in there and demand to speak to the shaman!Why not?You have to observe the protocol. The shaman demands tribute.Tribute? You mean, like a gift?That's right.The eternal question... What do you give a man who has everything?Give me a clue - what kind of things does your shaman like?Does he have a hobby? A favourite sport?I'm from California - why, we're practically neighbours!Oh, right. Maybe a book would be more suitable, or a jigsaw puzzle?Don't you just hate choosing presents for people you don't know?You insult us. The shaman lives on a higher plane.Here. He'll like these biscuits.So, is this your first visit to our planet?Me and Tabtic, we've appeared in seven TV films and an article in National Geographic.--This cone could have a thousand uses!Yeah? Like what?A protective helmet?I don't think so...Look - I know it's not much, but I want your shaman to have this.Do you expect him to eat that?He's an old man, you know. He might choke.-Would your wise man have any use for lipstick?Not in that colour!Haven't you anything in black?Of course I don't!He liked the biscuits - especially the black ones.I'll give them to him.It didn't work.What?This stone is what brought me here...Wait here.-Well, we all have our cross to bear. This is George. He has a request to make.I'm afraid I can't stay. Good luck, George!That's a relief. I never feel comfortable with him about...Me neither - these damned pants keep riding right up my butt...So, what do you want?Of course not! What do you think we are - savages?He wants to know if you've any more...Your feeble attempt to assassinate the shaman by concealing a dart within this box.I didn't mean to offend him.The shaman was pretty mad about those panties...That's a spirit stone! I wouldn't touch it if I was you...You're right. It could be cursed!The shaman said to give you back this statue.He didn't want it?He's already got one.The shaman kept your gift of wax.He was pleased with it.Can I go see him now?He wasn't that pleased.-----You didn't. He was disappointed that they didn't fit.You can't go in there!Stop! This is a private village!Hullo, boys! Glad to see you're still wearing the underpants...They're the best Christmas present we ever had, father.Mine are too tight.I didn't think the Indians would accept that gift...He didn't want the little worm.

Because he's an old spoil-sport sourpuss.I want to visit one of those old pyramid places, but Duane says he has to stay in town.Right - and you don't want to go on your own?Well, there's no point in going to the pyramid if there's no-one around to take my picture!Listen, sweetie - I'm looking for an official guide to take me to the old pyramid.George Stobbart! Well of all the...Mrs Henderson! Boy, this is some coincidence, huh?When you've been married to a fruitcake like Duane as long as I have, you stop believing in coincidence.What he doesn't know won't hurt him. Let's go, beanpole!For you, I will go as far as the pyramid and back. But what about your husband?I believe Kondor Transglobal is a front for an international drug smuggling ring.Did Duane tell you that, honey? I wouldn't take him too seriously if I was you.This isn't one of your husband's delusions, Pearl. I've seen their operations in Marseilles.I came to Quaramonte to track the source of the dope, but I've drawn a blank.Well, I can't see no international drug smugglers hangin' out in a place like this!Is Duane here with you, Mrs Henderson?Why, sure. I couldn't leave him home alone!Since Duane come back from the war, we couldn't bear to be apart.So where is he now?We ain't speakin'.I'd love to, but right now I have to save the world.-Have you met the guy who calls himself 'the General'?No, I haven't. Is he a real general?I guess so. He wears a lot of medals on his chest...What brings you to Quaramonte, Pearl?What takes me just about anywheres - the market.You drove two thousand miles to go shopping?Shopping is my role in the economy of the Great Design, George.I hear you drove all the way to Quaramonte - in a truck.That's right. You would not believe the state of some of those roads!It makes me downright sad t' think there's still some places you can't reach in an automobile!In this day and age, you'd think there'd be decent highways just about anywhere folk choose to go!Did you know that the truck was full of explosives?Whatever gave you that idea, as if I couldn't guess?Your husband. He was exaggerating, wasn't he?Sometimes I wonder how I'm gonna cope with Duane's over fertile imagination...I had no more to talk to her about.Catch you later, Pearl.-------What do you make of this stone, Pearl?Oh, that's pretty. What's that thing suppos'd to be - a rabbit?I believe it's a coyote.Well, it sure is cute.I was surprised she didn't ask me where she could buy one.What does this mean to you, Pearl?What cute little feathers! Why, if you had two of those, they'd sure make nice earrings!This isn't intended for frivolous personal adornment, Pearl.It's a dart, tipped with a fast-acting, muscle-numbing poison!Pardon me! I stand corrected, honey.Sometimes I got the feeling that communication with Pearl was like sending signals out into space...Maybe if you waited long enough you'd get an intelligent answer back, but it was a long shot.What do you make of this statue, Pearl?Hoo-wee! That's the spittin' image of Duane's brother Sheridan.A little less body hair, maybe, but it's him all right.Look at this, Pearl - a Tequila worm.Don't you bring that thing anywheres near me, honey.I swear, I'll scream like a hog on a hot plate!-----Take a look at this newscutting, Pearl.You'll have to read it to me, George. I left my specs in a gay bar in Santa Barbara.It's about an eclipse of the sun which is due to occur in a few weeks time.You'd think the government would warn us about these kinda things.Uh... It's not dangerous or anything. Apparently, the best place to view the eclipse is right here in Quaramonte!Oh, my.She didn't appear to be the slightest bit interested...Is Duane still working for the C.I.A.?If he is, he doesn't know it. He's what they call a Snoozer.Don't you mean a Sleeper?No - this is different. He used to think he worked for them, but the psycho-therapy cured him of that.What he doesn't realise is that now he really DOES work for them - at least that's the way I understood it...--For a lovely lady, I would go to the ends of the earth...--As Pearl and Renaldo set out for the ruined pyramid I prepared to search the police station...I'd met Pearl and Duane on the other side of the globe, in Syria.He was an Army veteran who suspected he was working for the C.I.A. but wasn't sure.She was less obviously deranged...--I've made the arrangements for your visit to the temple, Pearl.Oh, that's just great, George. Why don't you come too, honey?----Do you know where I could buy a detonator?Did Duane put you up to this, by any chance?Hey, come on! I was kidding. Did you think I was serious?I know what you boys are like when you get together and make plans...!Duane says he could solve all the world's problems if he had enough missiles.Duane thinks Kondor is smuggling Mayan antiques, but I think he's missed the point.It wouldn't surprise me.Oh, I get it - this is to detonate the truck load of explosives, right?--------...the wrong side of his chest, at least for any army I'd ever seen. ---Why aren't you speaking to Duane?lText Resource 3302	-`x��!o���p


It was a picture of some guy holding some other guy's head dress.
The other guy was saying, 'Hey! Lay off! Here, have this bowl instead'.
Actually, I have no idea what the picture represented.
These images must have meant something to the Maya.I had no idea what...There was a lever camouflaged within the wall design.Cool. Onwards and downwards, Mister Stobbart.For some reason, the wall decoration worried me.This was it. The pyramid's central chamber, its dark heart.Once before in my life, I'd stood in front of a door and thought...'This is it. If I go through there, I'm going to die.'I'd been wrong then.

Why don't you get some air - take a long walk along the pier?
I could stay here and watch the gate...
Ooh, no. You'd be through that gate as soon as my back was turned.With that crazy dog around? Some day I hope to have kids...Down boy! Down!Hey!

Otherwise, the dog gets an early breakfast!I wouldn't want him to change his eating habits on my account...Besides, I have brittle bones. He might choke.Oh, it doesn't matter...I gotta go now, but I'll be back.Can't wait.What time is it, anyhow?The big hand's on the four. Why aren't you in bed?I can explain everything...Never mind. I ain't that interested.What time do you open the gates?Seven.Do you mind if I hang out here 'til the docks open?Please yourself, but you'll have a long wait. It's Sunday.And tomorrow is the start of the national holiday. Everything is closed for a month.Well, wouldn't you just know it?Does that dog belong to you?Nah - he comes with the job. I just feed him every now and then.More 'then' than 'now', I'd say.What's the dog's name?Twenty.Unusual. For a dog...It's his registration number.

You always carry it around in your pocket?I heard it was lucky.Superstitious crap! I got a whole bucket of it in here and it ain't brought me no luck!At the docks? What kind of a woman do you have in mind?You don't understand -  it's my girl friend I'm trying to find.--Well, I ain't seen her, and you should tell her......the docks ain't no place for a young lady.

She ruined the whole damn thing for me, all that singing and stuff...Anyhow, she wasn't even a real kid. They stuffed her in a corset so her titties didn't show...Have you ever seen anything like this before?No, pal. What is it?A poisoned dart, used for hunting.What would you hunt with that - mice?No - monkeys and stuff. The tip is dipped in poison.Hey! What you got against monkeys...?I love monkeys. I was just using them as an example.Well, don't.Maybe I should have said Judy Garland instead of monkeys...This is the dart that the Indian shot at my girl friend...Sheesh!

There was nothing up there but nothing. Empty corridors and empty rooms.
There was a torch in a sconce by the doorway.
A really creepy statue. The figure held a skull and a bowl, probably for a heart to go in. Yeuch!

It looked like that wasn't all he'd caught.It was the band with no musical talent.It was the map the general hadn't wanted me to see.Hey, Nico!Rio's boat was strewn with fishing nets and tackle.-A couple of musicians stood watching life go on around them.The light shades looked completely out of place.There was nothing that I wanted to buy.It was a store cupboard.I wasn't going to buy anything from her!It was an uninteresting little wooden hut. I couldn't believe it! The goat had eaten the coal!With an armed goon outside it. The red-haired woman had an air of authority that might intimidate some men.And cats. And dogs. But not me!She terrified me.It was Conchita, the owner of the mining company.Hey! Wake up! It was Nico, wearing clothes I'd never seen before.It was one of Conchita's posse of hunks.I didn't want to talk to him.It was the weird guy who wasn't wearing pants...A disgustingly handsome man.I couldn't understand why the female owner had surrounded herself with men like this.In Quaramonte, defacing a poster was probably a capital offence.The guy was working away like an automaton.-That door looked pretty sturdy to me...The door was locked.Someone had thoughtfully provided little shades for the lightbulbs.The rest of the prison area looked like an English public toilet.I couldn't reach the light.-The soap had been replaced by a boring guy just talking to the camera.It was the map which the General had been showing to his guest...It was the map which the General had been showing to Professor Oubier...It looked like a geological survey map showing the land to the south-east of Quaramonte City.A gloomy passage led to the rear of the building.It was the passage which led to the town jail...I wasn't going to try investigating the passage while the General was sat there...I'd still have to figure out how to get rid of Renaldo before I went down there...It was General Grasiento, Quaramonte's reigning slimeball.It was a computer monitor with some kind of outdated game displayed on it...I didn't have time to get sidetracked by playing computer games...He had the eyes of a cocker spaniel set in a face like a deflated souffl�.I couldn't help wondering what had driven him to work for a man like the General...It was the General's aide.The television was showing what appeared to be a low-budget soap...A tall man with long blonde hair was shouting at a woman who was naked apart from a towel...Now they'd been joined by another, younger woman. She was blonde, too - the guy's sister, maybe.No - she was their maid! She's brought a tray with two glasses on it. She keeps shaking her head as if denying something...Oh, wow! The wife grabbed her by the hair - watch that towel, honey!They looked pretty depressed.I couldn't believe the Hendersons needed a truck that big to carry camping equipment...The cliff stopped me getting off the beach.I could hardly believe my eyes.The last time I'd seen that guy was in a market in Syria.It was Duane Henderson, the guy who thought he was a secret agent...It was Pearl's husband, Duane.Mr Henderson had a strange look of determination on his face...It was Quaramonte's police station.According to the sign over the door, this was Quaramonte's police station.It was the docks where our ship was still unloading.Now I like most animals, but experience had made me wary of goats.The mournful look in that goat's eyes was beginning to depress me.The stairs led up to the balcony.The stairs led to the office of the Quaramonte Mining CompanyIt was one of the windows of the jail.The cell was vacant.It was one of the cell windows.There was a forlorn looking guy asleep on the floor of the jail.It was Miguel, the pipe player.He wore the same clothes as the band in the market place...Hey, Miguel!About sixty miles inland and upstream was an area marked 'Teoculcan'.He didn't hear me.It was a friendly looking guy.Duane was waiting expectantly.It was that suspect archaeologist, Oubier.It was the guy I'd seen talking to the General.I recognised the woman immediately.Last time I'd seen her was in a market in Syria.It was Pearl Henderson, the globe trotting bargain hunter.It was Duane's wife, Pearl.Pearl had the glazed look of an obsessive consumer.It looked to me like an early portrait of Orson Welles...It was a portrait of La Presidenta.It was an armed guard looking after the barrier. Inside the hut was a chair and a small table.It was the office of the Quaramonte Customs and Excise department.The guy wasn't showing much enthusiasm selling his wares.The old woman was preparing a food that consisted of ground maize and lots of spittle.The maize and spittle concoction looked gross!The man was puffing away at a crudely rolled cigar.The woman had an impressive display of gourds.The guy was selling fish.It was a beat up old wreck of an Army truck...It was Duane's truck.Packed with high explosive, according to that amiable old paranoid...Reminded me of the time I was in Syria, but that's another story...It was the lock which held the door fastened.I didn't have the key to the lock.My fellow prisoner didn't look like he was gonna be a barrel of laughs...It was Miguel, the musician.It was a length of rope, knotted in a hangman's noose...I couldn't reach the noose.My very own slop bucket. Already I was feeling institutionalised...I wasn't going to demean myself by using the bucket until I was desperate...Solid bars protected the small window. I wasn't getting out that way!I couldn't escape that way...-There was nothing else I wanted in the cupboard.I didn't want to buy any of the stuff he had for sale.I've never seen the attraction of gourds and certainly didn't want to fill my pockets with them.The fish looked older than me. I really didn't want any.The outcrop was about the only feature on the cliff face.It was too high. I couldn't get up there.With the net to help me up there, climbing to the outcrop was no longer a problem.The net would help me get up onto the outcrop.Stealing trucks wasn't my style...The door lead back outside.I decided to leave the television switched on.The cliff was steep, too steep to climb without handholds......and I couldn't find any.It was the boat that Rio had bought me in.I was quite happy where I was, relatively speaking.It was Rio, waiting patiently in his fishing boat.The warm Caribbean.The sea looked inviting but I was here to do a job.No! It can't be!But it was. My lucky piece of coal.Rio, how far away is Ketch's Landing from here?Best part of ten miles. Why?Ten miles?That catapult must have been a lot more powerful than I thought.The door lead back outside to the market square.A dusty track led around to the back of the building. The doorway lead back to the outer office.A safe was tucked under the desk.-The safe was undoubtedly locked.A filing cabinet stood in the corner.-The filing cabinet was probably locked.The lock was too intricate to pick.A couple of 'special offer' letters were strewn across the desk.I had no need for junk mail. Especially someone else's.The rope was securely tied to one of the bars.I looped the rope around the bars and back through the noose.lText Resource 1880Eg���$@V��Ki���gxyz{|}~������I	F
A lava lamp, hip in a retro way. I had no doubt the General thought it was hip full stop. I didn't want the lava lamp. It was a portrait of some thug in a uniform. It was a portrait of the General's terrifying mother. I didn't want the picture. A stuffed swordfish. On close inspection, I noticed that the swordfish was peppered with machine-gun bullet holes. The General was a real sportsman and no mistake. Cutting edge technology, in 1978 at any rate. I didn't want to watch a lot of tawdry soap operas. A tigerskin lay on the floor.The tiger was beyond help. It was General Grasiento in full-on lounge lizard mode.The door represented the escape route.I longed to leave - but I had to buy George more time.I had to keep him talking - but what about? We had nothing in common!lText Resource 338�����9b����






Aaaaaaaah!!
What place is this?
I was in some sort of strange room.
Tiles and dials... the priests who designed this place must have known how to use them.
I was going to have to figure it out for myself if I ever wanted to get out of here.
It was the great stone head that had spat me out.It reminded me of an ex-boyfriend on both counts.The chute I'd arrived on was too steep and slippery to get back up.The room was dominated by an enormous device.Decorated with the usual Mayan motifs, it held two great discs, each covered in glyphs.It was the great disc machine.There were several tiles with glyphs on them.The tile didn't want to move.The tile moved slightly.There was a statue of a monkey. Some sort of religious significance?The monkey held a board containing more tiles with coloured glyphs on them.The tile didn't move at all.The tile moved inwards and clicked home.Ha, ha! Et voila!George once told me that there's a knack to finding secret doors.I think I'm beginning to get the hang of it.It was the secret exit that I had revealed by solving the glyphs puzzle.lText Resource 339���(_����Qjz�����(8q��X���=�������6H~�8An���&	R	�	�	�	






The door led back into the warehouse's top floor. This sign also looked firmly attached to the wall.It read 'Pont du Nord - fine wine producers'.I didn't recognise the label.Nico. I have a great idea.The din must have drowned out the sound of my knocking.The window looked like it hadn't been opened for many years.Those jaws looked like they could snap shut at any moment.A sturdy chain and padlock hung around the door handles.The doors looked a hundred years old, but they were still very sturdy.I just couldn't see anywhere to gain a leverage.Under the circumstances, painting graffiti on the doors was not the best plan.That would never work.--------------------------A barge was moored against the dock side.It was a big empty barge.The Indian lay spread-eagled among the barrels in the bottom of the barge.-It was a long way down - too far to jump.A fine old oak barrel...-A cable stretched way out across the docks to a building in the distance.I thought about hanging from the cable with my bare hands......but it was too far to the other end of the cable to escape that way.The cable was too thick and greasy to hold on to with my bare hands..The clamp consisted of two metal jaws which would close when weight was applied to them.The clamp was part of the barrel transportation system.The clamp was held in a mechanism which forced its jaws open.I decided not to tamper with the clamp.That door seemed to be the only way into the warehouse.The door led into the silent warehouse...It was a duct from a ventilation fan.The fan was making one hell of a noise.Jamming the boat hook in that fan had silenced it for good.The metal housing prevented me from getting to the fan.There was a little grill set into the door.The grill opened from the inside.The ladder led up to a walkway which stretched the length of the building.It was the access ladder which led to the walkway.The ladder was the only way back to the ground.Maybe there was a way in up there...NOT USED (See ds) High above was a canopied platform to which goods would be hoisted to the upper floor.There was no way of getting up there.NOT USED (See ds) Without a pair of wings or a jet pack, there was no way I was going to get up there.It read: 'Kondor Transglobal.'I'd come to the right place. Now all I had to do was get inside.The sign looked as if it was firmly attached to the wall.Anyway, I didn't really want it as a souvenir.It was a beautiful piece of nineteenth century engineering, but not a lot of use to me.I couldn't reach the wheel and couldn't see any point in climbing up to it.The window wasn't fully shut.The window was jammed shut.Even if he wasn't carrying a gun, I wouldn't want to mess with that guy.He looked like the kind of guy who'd shoot first and not bother with questions, so I kept quiet.lText Resource 2913Tq���/p���!9CRTVXZ\��MNvw��}



Outside was certain death...By the door was a pattern picked out in blue.The pattern meant nothing to me.On the wall was an intricate pattern in blue and gold.The pattern seemed to have only religious significance.There was a large image on the wall of a man in ceremonial garb.More usefully, there were also a couple of levers.The lever was made of stone.Ooof!The lever was very difficult to move and appeared to do nothing anyway.Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa..!I'd already tried that.Heeeeave!Still no good.-----It was George, just rescued from certain death and not looking suitably grateful.It was Titipoco.This was a time for action, not talk.lText Resource 33486��Ae�>��O��23456789:�I could see the marker I had fastened on the rock down in the forest ...... and right in line with it - the rock I was looking for.It was the marker which I had raised up the needle of rock.The hill I was on had reminded me of a camel's hump as I'd climbed up it.Now, I had to see what I could see.I could just make out a cave near the bottom of the rock. It didn't look too practical as a hiding place.It was a good cave for hiding treasure in. Shame about the flooding problem.A needle rock. Eye of the needle?Heck, Ketch could have hidden his treasure anywhere! This island's full of hiding places!There was an enormous cave. Every tourist for the last three centuries must've been in that one.An ugly little cave.
